<span class="smaller">AN ILL WIND</span></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>ashington</span>, Washington; all off for
Washington!” The porter’s stentorian
call echoed through the Pullman sleeper.
“This way out.”</p>

<p>A second more and the aisle was filled with
sleepy passengers who strove to push past each other
with the impatient rudeness which characterizes the
average American traveler. The last to leave the
car was a tall man, whose leisurely movements left
him a prey to a hovering porter, and he surrendered
his suit-case to the obsequious darky, after first inquiring
the way to the baggage room.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and engage a taxi for me,” he directed,
following his guide across the imposing concourse
and into the waiting-room.</p>

<p>“Yessir.” The porter touched his cap respectfully;
at one glance he had appraised the traveler’s
well-groomed appearance, and his palm itched for
the anticipated tip. “But you’d better hurry, suh;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>I kain’t hol’ a cab long, suh, an’ dey’s mighty scarce
at dis time ob de mawnin,’ suh.”</p>

<p>“All right.” The traveler quickened his steps,
corralled a half awake baggage clerk, gave his instructions,
and sought the southern entrance of the
station without further waste of time.</p>

<p>“Heah’s yo’ cab, suh,” called the porter. The
information was somewhat superfluous, for only one
taxi stood at the curb, the rest having been requisitioned
by other passengers. “Thank yo’, suh,”
added the porter, as his lingers closed over a half
dollar; his intuition had not been wrong. “Where
to, suh?”</p>

<p>His question remained unanswered, for the traveler
shouldered him aside, and gave his directions
to the chauffeur in so low a tone that they were not
overheard, then entered the cab and settled himself
comfortably on the roomy seat. Half dozing he
took no notice of the taxi’s progress up Massachusetts
Avenue to Sheridan Circle, and was only
aroused from his nap by the abrupt stopping of the
vehicle before a white marble residence of imposing
size. He started to leave the taxi, then drew back.</p>

<p>“Lord!” he grumbled, inspecting the drawn blinds
and closed vestibule door. “I forgot I’m still south
of Mason and Dixon’s line; everybody’s asleep.”</p>

<p>“Want to be driven around a bit, sir?” questioned
the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“I do not,” dryly, glancing askance at the register.
He pulled out his watch and scanned the dial. “Six-fifteen.
Any Turkish Baths near here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“The Riggs’ Bath is the best, sir; get you there
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” and with a resigned sigh, the traveler
leaned back and studied his surroundings with interest
as the taxi passed down the quiet thoroughfares.
On approaching the business section of the
city there were more signs of life, and in crossing a
street the taxi was held up by a number of heavy
drays.</p>

<p>In the pause that followed the traveler casually
inspected the side of a red brick basement house
whose entrance fronted on the other street. The
windows of what appeared to be a library on the
second floor were open, letting in the balmy air
which accompanies Indian Summer in the Capital
City, and the traveler saw a colored servant dusting
the room. His feather duster, wielded with
unusual vigor, struck against some papers lying on
a desk by the window, and the topmost sheet sailed
out. The wind carried it to the gutter where a
small stream of water from the recently flushed
street swept it along to the sewer opening, where
it poised for a moment on the brink, then disappeared
into the dark depths beneath. The servant,
leaning half out of the window, breathlessly watched
the paper’s progress with eyes and mouth wide
open, and his ludicrously agonized expression drew
a faint chuckle from the traveler as his taxi started
down the street.</p>

<p>Some time later the traveler, refreshed by his bath,
lay back in the luxuriously furnished dormitory of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>the Riggs’ Turkish Bath and puffed contentedly at
his cigar. He paid no attention to three be-sheeted
men who were talking together as they lounged at
one end of the room.</p>

<p>“Who was the pretty girl you were dancing with
yesterday afternoon at the Shoreham, Jimmie?”
questioned the eldest of the three men.</p>

<p>“Janet Fordyce.” Jimmie Painter’s voice was of
the carrying kind, and as the name reached his ears
the traveler sat bolt upright, but the men, engrossed
in their conversation, failed to observe his attention.
“A winner, isn’t she, Logan?” continued Jimmie complacently.</p>

<p>“Yes, trust you to pick ’em,” grumbled Logan,
“and to cultivate them afterwards, too. Who is
she?”</p>

<p>“Daughter of Calderon Fordyce, the Western
importer of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Opium&mdash;tainted money,” jeered his companion.</p>

<p>“What difference? Its buying qualities make it
refined gold.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t the only one bowled over by the
Fordyce girl,” remarked the youngest member of
the group. “She made quite an impression on
Chichester Barnard.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing there, Cooper!” exclaimed Jimmie
Painter skeptically. “Chichester’s not the kind
to be attracted by a débutante; besides, he’s too gone
on Marjorie Langdon.”</p>

<p>“Not so gone he doesn’t keep his weather eye out,”
retorted Joe Calhoun-Cooper. “As far as Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>Langdon’s concerned it’s attention without intention.
She’s as poor as Job’s turkey.”</p>

<p>“I hear she’s crazy about Chichester,” volunteered
Logan. “By Jove! if I was first favorite, I’d marry
Miss Langdon and risk poverty.”</p>

<p>“Too Utopian,” commented Joe. “Better choose
a golden ‘Bud’&mdash;they are the only kind worth plucking
in Washington.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” put in Jimmie Painter. “Do
you suppose old Calderon Fordyce will come across
with the money bags when his daughter marries?”</p>

<p>“I’m told he’s rolling in wealth,” acknowledged
Joe. “But for all that, you’d better go slow, Jimmie;
there’s some kink in the family.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“An intimate friend said&mdash;&mdash;” Joe never finished
the sentence, for an iron hand jerked him to his
feet and swung him about face.</p>

<p>“I have been an unwilling listener to your conversation,”
said the traveler slowly, addressing the
astounded men, and not loosening his hold on Joe.
“You can congratulate yourselves that you live in
Washington; such discussion of women would not be
tolerated elsewhere. I give you fair warning, each
and all of you, if you mention Miss Fordyce’s name
in future conversations I will break every bone in
your bodies.”</p>

<p>It was no idle threat; the sheet had slipped from
the traveler’s broad shoulders, disclosing the brawn
and build of an athlete.</p>

<p>“You understand me,” he added, his level glance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>seeking Joe’s, and his vice-like grip tightened until
the bones cracked.</p>

<p>“Yes, d-mn you!” muttered Joe, through clenched
teeth. “Let go.”</p>

<p>“Who the &mdash;&mdash; are you?” gasped Jimmie, hastily
retreating beyond the traveler’s reach.</p>

<p>“Miss Fordyce’s brother&mdash;Duncan Fordyce,” was
the calm reply, and Joe, released suddenly, collapsed
on his couch.</p>

<span class="smaller">MISSING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“Y</span>ou</span> are, then, absolutely positive that Miss
Langdon called up Mr. Barnard the last
thing before leaving this room yesterday
afternoon?” questioned Rear Admiral Lawrence,
with such quiet persistence that pretty Nurse Allen
opened her eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>“I cannot swear that it was the last thing Miss
Langdon did before leaving here,” she answered,
somewhat dryly. “I only know I found her at the
telephone when I came in to ring up Dr. McLane,
and I overheard her address the person she was
speaking to over the wire as ‘Chichester,’ and tell
him it was important that she see him.”</p>

<p>“Did Miss Langdon appear agitated?”</p>

<p>Nurse Allen shook her head. “Her manner
seemed to be the same as usual; but she looked
pale and tired.”</p>

<p>“Was Miss Langdon holding this photograph in
her hand?” As he spoke the Admiral fumbled
among the papers on his desk and knocked to the
floor the picture he was seeking. Muttering an
ejaculation, he stooped to get it, but Nurse Allen
was before him and, her color heightened by her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>hasty exertion, picked up the photograph. She barely
glanced at the kodak likeness of Chichester Barnard,
but she read the message scrawled across the
bottom: “Love’s young dream&mdash;à la bonne heure!
C. B.,” before replacing the photograph on the
desk.</p>

<p>“It may have been in Miss Langdon’s hand,” she
said indifferently. “I was only here for a second,
as Sam brought me word that Dr. McLane had
come and I hurried back to Mrs. Lawrence. I really
can give you no information about the photograph.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no matter; I found it lying by the telephone.
I suppose&mdash;&mdash;” the Admiral broke off abstractedly
and drummed with nervous fingers on the back of the
chair against which he was leaning. In the pause
Nurse Allen permitted her eyes to wander downward
to the photograph lying face upward near her, and
a ghost of a smile touched her mobile lips. Clever
as she was in her chosen profession, she was not,
in this instance, a discriminating observer, and utterly
failed to connect the scrawled message on the
photograph with the faint mockery traceable in
Chichester Barnard’s expressive eyes. The snap-shot
was a good likeness, and Barnard’s fine physique and
handsome features were reproduced without flattery.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me how long Miss Langdon remained
alone in this room?” asked Admiral Lawrence
suddenly arousing himself.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I have no idea. I did not come here
again, until you sent for me this morning.”</p>

<p>The Admiral stepped over to the window and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>raised the Holland shade until the room was flooded
with sunlight.</p>

<p>“I won’t detain you longer,” he announced, turning
back to the young nurse. “You will oblige me
greatly by making no mention of our conversation.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.” Nurse Allen turned a mystified
gaze on her employer as she walked toward the
door. “I’ll be in my room if you want me. The
day nurse is with Mrs. Lawrence now.”</p>

<p>The Admiral heaved an impatient sigh as the door
closed behind her, and seating himself at his desk
turned his attention to several sheets of manuscript,
but they failed to hold his interest. A soft knock
at the library door interrupted him, and he looked
up with an air of relief.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he called. “Oh, good morning, Marjorie,”
as a girl appeared in the doorway. “Aren’t
you late this morning?”</p>

<p>“I was detained,” explained Marjorie Langdon,
glancing in some embarrassment at the Admiral; she
had not expected to find him at his desk. “How is
Mrs. Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“About the same,” a deep sigh accompanied the
words. “Dr. McLane holds out little hope of her
recovery. She may live a month, or&mdash;&mdash;” his gesture
of despair completed the sentence.</p>

<p>“I am grieved to hear it,” Marjorie looked at
the Admiral much distressed. “Is there anything
I can do for Mrs. Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I am afraid not,” he replied, carefully
turning his back to the light. He did not wish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>even his confidential secretary to read the anxiety
and sorrow written so plainly on his haggard face.
His vigils in the sick-room were breaking down his
usually rigid self-control. “Is there any mail for
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I found it on the hall table. There
are a number of notes inquiring about your wife, and
a letter from your publisher.” Marjorie left her
typewriter desk and approached the Admiral, letters
in hand. “Do you wish to dictate the answers?”</p>

<p>“Not just now.” The Admiral took the neatly
assorted letters from her and without examining
their contents, tossed them down on his flat-top desk.
“There is a matter of importance”&mdash;he stopped and
cleared his throat&mdash;“you recall typewriting a codicil
to my wife’s will?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” put in Marjorie, as the Admiral
paused again.</p>

<p>“You made a carbon copy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because your lawyer, Mr. Alvord, thought that
Mrs. Lawrence, through weakness, might spoil her
signature on the first sheet, and he wished to have a
second copy at hand if it should be needed.”</p>

<p>“Do you recall what transpired after the signing
of the codicil?”</p>

<p>“Very distinctly,” replied Marjorie, her surprise
at the continued questioning showing in her manner.
“After the witnesses signed the document, Mr. Alvord
returned here to collect his papers. Just as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>he was leaving you came in and asked him to leave
the signed codicil.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” broke in the Admiral. “Mrs. Lawrence
wished it left here, in order to read it again
when she felt stronger. Before returning to my
wife, I requested you to put the codicil in my
safe....”</p>

<p>“I carried out your instructions,” declared Marjorie,
her heart beating faster with a nameless dread.</p>

<p>“By placing the <i>unsigned</i> carbon copy of the codicil
in the safe&mdash;” an ironical smile twisted the Admiral’s
lips. “You improved on my instructions.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s lovely hazel-gray eyes widened in
horror as the meaning of his words dawned upon
her.</p>

<p>“You are entirely mistaken,” she protested vehemently.
“I put the codicil Mr. Alvord gave me in
the safe&mdash;upon my word of honor!”</p>

<p>“I found the unsigned copy there an hour ago,”
replied the Admiral steadily.</p>

<p>“The other must be there, too,” Marjorie moved
impetuously toward the small safe which was partly
hidden from sight by a revolving bookcase. “Let
me look&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary.” Marjorie wheeled about
and her face crimsoned at the curtness of his tone.
“I have just searched the entire contents of the safe&mdash;the
signed codicil is not there.”</p>

<p>“You must be wrong,” gasped Marjorie. “Mr.
Alvord had the carbon copy; how could I put it in
the safe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“I have just telephoned Alvord,” said the Admiral
quickly. “He declares he left the carbon copy on
my desk.”</p>

<p>There was a ghastly pause. The Admiral glanced
keenly at his silent companion, and his eyes lighted
in reluctant admiration of her beauty. Unconscious
of his scrutiny, Marjorie studied the pattern of the
rug with unseeing eyes, striving to collect her confused
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Are you engaged to Chichester Barnard?” inquired
the Admiral, abruptly.</p>

<p>The point blank question drove every vestige of
color from Marjorie’s cheeks. Slowly she turned
and regarded the Admiral from head to foot.</p>

<p>“You have no right to ask that question,” she
said icily.</p>

<p>“That is a matter of opinion,” retorted the Admiral
heatedly. “I think circumstances have given
me that right. My wife, in this codicil, revoked her
bequest to her nephew, Chichester Barnard”&mdash;he
stopped impressively. “Alvord took down my wife’s
instructions, then came here and, without my knowledge,
had you typewrite the codicil. The night nurse,
Miss Allen, tells me that after Alvord’s departure
she came in here to use the telephone, and you were
talking to Chichester. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I rang him up,” defiantly. “I have done
the same in the past.”</p>

<p>The Admiral sighed. “Miss Allen informed me
that she overheard you tell Chichester that you must
see him at once on a matter of importance.” He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>paused, waiting for some comment, but Marjorie
stood as if turned to stone, and he continued more
gently, “Come, Marjorie, own up that a mistaken,
loyal impulse to aid and protect a&mdash;lover”&mdash;Marjorie
shivered and her cold fingers plucked
nervously at her gown&mdash;“prompted you to hold back
the signed codicil. I will forget the matter if you
will return the document to me.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t the codicil,” she protested.</p>

<p>“You have destroyed it?” leaning intently toward
her.</p>

<p>“No. I have already told you I placed the paper
in the safe.”</p>

<p>The Admiral’s face hardened. “You still stick
to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The truth,” proudly. “I have been your amanuensis
for nearly two years; in that time have I ever
lied to you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you must believe my word now.”</p>

<p>Without replying the Admiral wheeled about in
his swivel chair and looked through the window at
the street below. Marjorie could read nothing
from the side view of his face, and her heart
sank. Suddenly he swung back and confronted her
again.</p>

<p>“I think it would be as well if you resigned,” he
said, coldly.</p>

<p>The room swam before Marjorie; she felt half
suffocated, then hot anger came to her rescue, and
she pulled herself together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“You are treating me with shameful injustice,”
she began, her eyes glowing with indignation.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am most lenient,” retorted the
Admiral. “You have been guilty of a criminal
act&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I deny it absolutely,” exclaimed Marjorie passionately.
“You have no grounds for such an accusation.”</p>

<p>“You had both incentive and opportunity to steal
that signed codicil,” declared the Admiral, paying
scant attention to her denial. “Chichester Barnard
stands to lose a hundred thousand dollars by that
codicil; lack of funds prevents him from marrying
a poor girl”&mdash;Marjorie winced visibly and bit her
lips to hide their trembling. “You were the last
person to leave this room yesterday afternoon; I
never came in here again until this morning. You
had the signed codicil in your possession, you knew
the combination of the safe; the carbon copy was
lying on this desk&mdash;the substitution was easy!”</p>

<p>“Supposing your preposterous charge is true,”
said Marjorie slowly. “What good could I hope to
accomplish by such a substitution?”</p>

<p>“After the excitement of signing the codicil, my
wife suffered a relapse, and was not expected to live
through the night. If she dies”&mdash;the Admiral
shaded his eyes, which had grown moist, with his
hand&mdash;“only the unsigned codicil is here; therefore
Chichester Barnard, by the terms of her will, will
inherit her bequest. However, my wife still lives,
and when she regains consciousness I shall have her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>sign this carbon copy,” opening his desk drawer and
removing a folded paper. “After all, you were only
partially successful.”</p>

<p>“To succeed, one must first undertake,” retorted
Marjorie. “Tell me, please, if you thought I would
betray your trust, why did you give me the codicil
to place in the safe?”</p>

<p>“First, because I was not aware you knew the
contents of the paper; secondly, I never knew there
was a carbon copy; thirdly, my wife’s precarious
condition effectually put out of my mind your infatuation
for Chichester Barnard.”</p>

<p>“My infatuation?” echoed Marjorie, a slow, painful
blush creeping up her white cheeks. “You are
hardly complimentary, Admiral.”</p>

<p>“Put it any way you wish,” he replied wearily. “I
must ask you to hurry and gather your belongings,
Miss Langdon, for I must return to my wife.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be a minute.” Stung by his tone, Marjorie
hurried to her desk and rapidly put the drawers
in order. As she covered the typewriter she paused
and gazed about the pleasant, sunlit room through
tear-dimmed eyes. She had spent many happy hours
there, for both Admiral and Mrs. Lawrence had
done much to make her comfortable, and the work
had been interesting and comparatively easy. What
had induced the Admiral to credit so monstrous a
charge against her? She stiffened with indignation,
and picking up the key of her desk, walked over to
him. He looked up at her approach, and the full
light from the window betrayed the increasing lines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>and wrinkles about his mouth and eyes. His hair
had whitened, and his usually ruddy cheeks were
pale.</p>

<p>“Here is the key of my desk,” she said, laying it
down before him. “The carbon copy of your book
is in the right-hand drawer, and your official and
business correspondence fills the other drawers. Will
you please examine them before I leave.”</p>

<p>He rose in silence and went swiftly through the
contents of the typewriter desk. “Everything is
correct,” he acknowledged, noting with inward approval
the neat and orderly arrangement of his correspondence.</p>

<p>“Then I will leave; my hat and coat are downstairs,”
and with a formal bow Marjorie turned
toward the door.</p>

<p>“One moment;” the Admiral stepped back to his
own desk. “You forget your check; I have made it
out for one month in advance, in lieu of notice.”</p>

<p>Mechanically Marjorie’s fingers closed over the
slip of paper extended to her; then she drew her
slender, graceful figure erect.</p>

<p>“I am a girl, alone in the world,” she said clearly.
“I have had to take your insults today, but thank
God, I can refuse to take your money.”</p>

<p>The torn check fell in a tiny shower at the Admiral’s
feet as the hall door banged to behind her
vanishing figure.</p>

<p>The seconds had slipped into minutes before
the Admiral moved; then he dropped into his
desk chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“What does she see in Chichester?” he muttered.
“What is there about that scoundrel which attracts
women? Where’s that photograph?”</p>

<p>But his search was unavailing; the photograph had
disappeared.</p>

<span class="smaller">QUESTIONS AND QUERIES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arjorie Langdon</span> contemplated her
small wardrobe as it lay spread out before
her on the bed, and then gazed at the passbook
open in her hand. She saw the slender balance
remaining to her credit at the bank through diminishing
glasses, and despair tugged at her heart-strings.</p>

<p>“The way of the bread-winner is hard,” she paraphrased
bitterly. “I don’t wonder there are so many
transgressors in the world. Bless my soul, Minerva,
what do you want?”</p>

<p>The colored woman, who had entered the bedroom
unnoticed a second before, actually jumped at
the sharpness of Marjorie’s usually tranquil voice.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, miss; but I knocked an’ knocked at
de do’ ’till I was plum’ tired. My, ain’t dem pretty?”
catching a glimpse of the dresses on the bed. “Is
ye fixin’ ter go ter a party?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” wearily. “I am sorry I kept you
waiting, but I was&mdash;thinking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss; I heard yo’ a talkin’ ter yo’self, an’
calculated yo’ didn’t hyar me.” Minerva backed
toward the door. “Lunch am ready.”</p>

<p>“Is it time?” exclaimed Marjorie, glancing in surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
at her wrist-watch, whose hands pointed to
three minutes past one. “I’ll be right down; tell
Madame Yvonett not to wait for me.”</p>

<p>“Marse Tom’s hyar,” volunteered Minerva, as
she disappeared over the threshold, closing the door
behind her.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Marjorie bathed her face, the
cool water bringing some relief to her throbbing
temples, then after rearranging her hair, she paused
a moment and anxiously regarded her reflection in
the mirror. Except for an increased pallor, her expression
gave no indication of the shock the stormy
interview with Admiral Lawrence had given her.
Feverishly pinching her cheeks in hopes of restoring
her customary color, and without stopping to replace
her gowns in the closet, she left the room and ran
downstairs.</p>

<p>Six years previous Marjorie’s father, John Langdon,
had died a bankrupt, and his worldly possessions
had gone under the hammer to meet the demands
of his creditors. His widow, never very
strong, had soon succumbed to the unequal struggle
for existence that confronted her, and after the death
of her mother, Marjorie had made her home with
her great-aunt, Madame Yvonett, who owned a
small house on Thirteenth Street, opposite Franklin
Square. She insisted on contributing her share to
the household expenses, for Madame Yvonett had
trusted her business affairs to her nephew’s management,
and when John Langdon failed, most of her
property had gone in the general smash, and she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>eked out her curtailed income by taking paying
guests.</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett, a Philadelphian by birth, belonged
to a distinguished Quaker family, and at the
age of sixteen had been, as the quaint term runs,
“read out of meeting for marrying one of the world’s
people.” Henri Yvonett had wooed and won the
beautiful Quakeress when attached to the French
Legation, as it was then, and afterwards he was
promoted to other diplomatic posts. On his death
some eighteen years before, Madame Yvonett had
made Washington her home, and her house became
one of the centers of fashionable life.</p>

<p>Her financial difficulties came when she was approaching
three-score years and ten, but only Marjorie
divined the pang that her changed fortunes cost
the beautiful Quaker dame, for she never discussed
her troubles in public. She faced adversity with
quiet fortitude; gave up her handsome residence on
Scott Circle, dismissed her staff of servants, and
moved into the Thirteenth Street house, which had
been one of her investments in happier days.</p>

<p>Marjorie hastened into the dining-room and found
her great-aunt in animated conversation with her
cousin, Captain Thomas Nichols, of the &mdash;th Field
Artillery, who rose at her entrance.</p>

<p>“How are you, Madge?” he exclaimed, extending
both hands in greeting.</p>

<p>“Very well, and very glad to see you,” she replied
cordially. “Aunt Yvonett, I am sorry to be late, do
excuse me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Thee is only a few minutes behind time, and
Thomas has kept me very agreeably entertained,”
answered the Quakeress. She had always retained
her “plain speech,” and in her dress, the soft grays
and browns of the Friends. Silvery curls framed a
face of the eighteenth-century type, and, with arms,
still rounded and white, showing below her elbow
sleeves, with the folds of a white fichu across her
breast, she made a novel and lovely picture as she
sat at the head of the table. “Will thee have some
tea?” she asked.</p>

<p>“If you please.” Marjorie slipped into a seat opposite
her aunt. “What brings you over from Fort
Myer, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Had to go to the War Department. Try some
of these beaten biscuit, Madge, Minerva has excelled
herself,” smiling gaily at the colored woman. “I
thought Cousin Yvonett would take pity on me and
give me a bite.”</p>

<p>“I am always pleased to see thee, Thomas,” answered
Madame Yvonett. “But if thee only wants
a bite, thee should join the ‘Hunger Club.’”</p>

<p>“The ‘Hunger Club’?” echoed Tom. “It doesn’t
sound encouraging; is it anything like the ‘starvation
parties’ in Richmond before that city surrendered
to Grant?”</p>

<p>“Only alike in that they both leave much to be
desired,” smiled Madame Yvonett. “The club was
organized two weeks ago by eleven wealthy women;
the twelfth place being left for an invited guest. A
prize will be awarded at the end of the season to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>the hostess who has given the most appetizing
luncheon for the least money.”</p>

<p>“How are they going to know how much each
luncheon costs?”</p>

<p>“The hostess is required to write the price of every
course on the back of the place cards. The object
of the club is to encourage simplified living in fashionable
circles,” she went on to explain. “I was the
invited guest at the luncheon yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Did you get anything to eat?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“She ate something before she went,” supplemented
Marjorie mischievously.</p>

<p>“Only some biscuits and a glass of sherry,” protested
Madame Yvonett. “Thee sees, Thomas, I
do not like to have my digestion upset, and I took
precautions; a cold water luncheon never agrees with
me.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they give you anything solid to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the luncheon, such as there was of it, was
very nice. But the discussion of the food and its
price quite destroyed my appetite.”</p>

<p>“You prefer a soupçon of gossip to season a delicacy,”
teased Tom. “I bet you christened it the
‘Hunger Club.’”</p>

<p>“Your invitation read ‘to meet the Economy
Luncheon Club,’” Marjorie reminded her aunt.</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett smiled as she helped herself to
some butter. “Did thee not return earlier than usual
from the Lawrences’, Marjorie?” she asked.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Marjorie stiffened; she had dreaded
the question. She dared not tell her aunt of Admiral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>Lawrence’s accusation. Their physician had warned
her that Madame Yvonett must not be excited, or
she would bring on one of her heart attacks. The
last seizure two months before had been most severe,
Marjorie having found her aunt lying unconscious
on the floor of her bedroom. Knowing Madame
Yvonett’s indomitable spirit she realized that nothing,
save perhaps physical weakness, would prevent
her from seeing Admiral Lawrence and demanding
an instant retraction of his charge against her niece.
Such scenes would undoubtedly bring on a return of
her heart trouble, perhaps with fatal results. Marjorie
turned cold at the thought; Madame Yvonett
was very dear to her. But what excuse could she
give for her dismissal except the truth?</p>

<p>“I hear Mrs. Lawrence is not expected to live,”
said Tom, breaking the slight pause.</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” demanded Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Chichester Barnard; I met him on my way here.
By the way, he wished me to tell you he would not
be able to go to Mrs. Marsh’s tea with you this
afternoon on account of a business engagement,” he
glanced curiously at her, but Marjorie was occupied
in making bread pellets and it was several seconds
before she spoke.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lawrence is critically ill. The Admiral is
constantly at her bedside, and he cannot attend to
his book, so Aunt Yvonett,” looking gravely at her,
“my services are not required.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that thee is to have a vacation,” replied
the Quakeress; “but I am distressed to hear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>that Mrs. Lawrence is worse; she is a lovely woman,
her husband can ill spare her.”</p>

<p>“You must come over and spend the day at my
quarters, Cousin Yvonett, now that Madge has time
at her disposal,” broke in Tom. “The drills are
being held every Friday afternoon, and I know you
enjoy them.”</p>

<p>“Thee is most kind, and if the weather permits
we will come. Who was thy friend who came to the
door with thee this morning, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Joe Cooper. I didn’t bring him in, Cousin Yvonett,
because, to be frank, I don’t fancy the fellow.”</p>

<p>“I thought he was quite nice,” announced Marjorie,
arousing from her abstraction. “He is certainly
most obliging.”</p>

<p>“Boot-licking,” with scornful emphasis.</p>

<p>“That’s hardly fair,” exclaimed Marjorie. “He
had nothing to gain by being nice to me, and secondly,
his father, J. Calhoun-Cooper, is a representative
in Congress, and I am told, is very wealthy.”</p>

<p>“He has money,” acknowledged Tom grudgingly,
“and that’s about all. Joe’s grandfather started his
fortune digging ditches in Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“I know now of whom thee speaks,” interposed
Madame Yvonett. “But thee is mistaken; he didn’t
dig ditches, he paved streets. Brother Hugh helped
John Cooper to get his start in life; at one time he
slept in our barn chamber.”</p>

<p>“I’d like Joe to hear that,” chuckled Tom. “He
and I were at Lawrenceville together, and I had
enough of his purse-pride there. The Calhoun-Coopers&mdash;don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
forget the hyphen, Cousin Yvonett&mdash;have
leased your old house on Scott Circle.”</p>

<p>Marjorie, her observation quickened by the deep
love and veneration in which she held her aunt, detected
the shadow which crossed the benign old face
and the dimming of the bright eyes as memories of
other days crowded upon the Quakeress, and she
swiftly changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Cousin Rebekah Graves is coming this afternoon
to spend the winter with us,” she volunteered.
“What day can we bring her to Fort Myer, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Come this Friday&mdash;&mdash;” he stopped speaking as
Minerva appeared from the hall and approached
Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Hyar’s a note done come fo’ yo’, Miss Marjorie,
and de chuffer’s waitin’ fo’ an answer.”</p>

<p>Marjorie scanned the fine, precise writing; it was
not a hand she recognized, and handwriting to her
was like a photograph. Excusing herself, she tore
open the envelope and perused the note.</p>

<p>“Listen to this, Aunt Yvonett,” she began and
read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right">Sheridan Circle.</p>

<p class ="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Langdon</span>:</p>

<p>I had expected to make your acquaintance before this date,
but moving into my new home has occupied all my time.
Can you come and take tea with me this afternoon at five
o’clock? I am an old school friend of your mother’s, and as
such I hope you will overlook the informality of my invitation.
Trusting that I shall see you later, believe me,</p>

<p class="right2">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>Wednesday.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Flora Fordyce</span>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“It must be Janet Fordyce’s mother,” added Marjorie.
“They have bought the Martin house. Who
was Mrs. Calderon Fordyce before her marriage,
Aunt Yvonett?”</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett shook her head. “I cannot tell
thee. I was abroad when thy mother was a schoolgirl,
and knew none of her classmates. Will thee
accept Mrs. Fordyce’s invitation?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Cousin Rebekah’s train arrives at
three-thirty; I will have plenty of time to meet her
and bring her here first. I must answer Mrs. Fordyce’s
note,” and pushing back her chair she hastened
into the parlor which was fitted up as a living-room.
She was sealing her note when Tom Nichols
joined her.</p>

<p>“Let me give it to the chauffeur,” he exclaimed,
taking the envelope from her. “I’ll come right
back.”</p>

<p>Marjorie was still sitting before the mahogany
desk when Tom returned. “May I smoke?” he inquired,
pulling out his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>She nodded absently; then turned and studied him
covertly as he stood by the fireplace intent on lighting
his cigarette, his well-knit, soldierly figure silhouetted
against the flickering light from the wood fire
blazing on the hearth. They were second cousins,
and since his detail with his battery at Fort Myer,
Virginia, she had grown to know and admire the
fine qualities and kindly heart carefully hidden under
his off-hand manner. She debated whether she
should take him into her confidence. He was her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>nearest male relative; he would surely advise her
how best to refute Admiral Lawrence’s charge, and
help her to prove her innocence of the theft of the
codicil.</p>

<p>“Where is Aunt Yvonett?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“She went upstairs to lie down.” Tom threw a
half-burnt match into the fire, crossed the room, and
sat down facing Marjorie. “What’s up, Madge?”
he questioned gravely. “You are not a bit like yourself.
Won’t you tell me the cause?”</p>

<p>“I had just decided to ask your advice; thank
you for making it easier for me,” a pitiful little
smile accompanied the words, and Tom impulsively
clasped her hand in his.</p>

<p>“Little Cousin,” he began earnestly. “I don’t like
to see you so constantly with Chichester Barnard.
I am sure he is making you unhappy.”</p>

<p>Marjorie whitened to her lips. “I, unhappy?”
she exclaimed. “No, you overestimate his abilities.”</p>

<p>“No I don’t; Chichester is more than merely
handsome, he is fascinating; and his influence is the
greater.”</p>

<p>Marjorie rose slowly to her feet and a long sigh
escaped her.</p>

<p>“After all, Tom, I don’t believe I’ll confide in
you&mdash;you would not understand.”</p>

<span class="smaller">TEMPTING FATE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arjorie</span>, on her way out to keep her appointment
with Mrs. Calderon Fordyce,
paused in the hall to examine the mail
which Minerva, deeply engrossed in the arrival of
Miss Rebekah Graves, had deposited on the hat-stand
and forgotten. Two of the envelopes contained
circulars, and she tossed them back on the
marble stand, but the third was a note from their
family lawyer curtly informing Marjorie that the
savings bank in which Madame Yvonett kept a
small reserve account, had failed, and asking her to
break the news to her aunt.</p>

<p>Marjorie stumbled back and leaned weakly
against the newel post, her strength stricken from
her. All that Madame Yvonett had been able to
save&mdash;gone! Oh, it was too cruel to be believed!
From upstairs came the sound of voices, and her
aunt’s merry laugh rang out cheerily. “The lightest
heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning”&mdash;the
words recurred to Marjorie as she started blindly
up the stairs, the lawyer’s letter still clutched in her
hand.</p>

<p>She found her aunt in her bedroom talking to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>Miss Rebekah Graves, a spinster whose brusque and
didactic manner often gave offense. She had also a
most annoying habit of dragging in her religious
beliefs in ordinary conversation, and her intimate
knowledge of the divine intentions of Providence
was a constant source of wonder to her friends.
Opposite as they were in character and beliefs, she
and Madame Yvonett were warmly attached to each
other, and Marjorie was thankful for the spinster’s
presence, fearing as she did that her bad news might
give Madame Yvonett another heart attack. As
gently as she could she told her aunt of her financial
loss.</p>

<p>“Thee means, child, that my money is gone?”
asked Madame Yvonett dully, as Marjorie came to
a breathless pause.</p>

<p>“Yes. The bank has failed....”</p>

<p>“The Lord’s will be done!” ejaculated Miss Rebekah
in devout resignation.</p>

<p>“Thee is wrong, Rebekah; thy God and mine had
no hand in the bank’s failure,” retorted Madame
Yvonett, her keen sense of humor dominating her
impulse to cry as the realization of her loss dawned
upon her. “The devil who tempts men to wickedness
has wrought <i>his</i> will in this. What is thee giving me,
Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“Some cognac; you must take it, Aunt Yvonett,”
noting the pallor stealing upward and the trembling
of the bravely smiling lips. “You must not worry,
dearie,” handing her the wineglass. “I have a feeling
luck is going to change....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Misfortunes never come singly,” prophesied
Miss Rebekah, her pessimistic spirit surrendering at
once to dismal forebodings.</p>

<p>“Rot!” exclaimed Marjorie, darting an indignant
glance at the spinster, who bridled at the disrespectful
intonation of her voice. “You are not to worry,
Aunt Yvonett; I’ll recover that money by hook or
by crook. Cousin Becky will look after you until
I return from seeing Mrs. Fordyce. I won’t be any
longer than I can help,” and gathering up her belongings,
she departed.</p>

<p>The clocks were just chiming the hour of five
when Marjorie reached her destination, and a footman
in imposing livery showed her at once into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon,” he announced, and disappeared
behind the silken portières.</p>

<p>At first Marjorie thought she was alone as she
advanced into the room, then her eyes, grown accustomed
to the softly shaded lights, detected a small,
white-haired woman sitting in a large easy chair
who rose as she drew nearer, and Marjorie saw
that she was a hunchback.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come,” she said, taking the
hand Marjorie held out in both her own, and leading
her gently forward. “But, my dear, I thought
you were much older,” her eyes traveling over the
girl’s beautifully molded features and small, well-set
head. The November wind had restored the
roses in Marjorie’s cheeks, and she made a charming
picture in her well-cut calling costume and becoming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>hat, both presents from a wealthy friend who had
gone into mourning. “It was years ago that your
mother wrote me of your birth....”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she told you of my sister who died,”
suggested Marjorie. “She was eight years my
senior.”</p>

<p>“That must have been it; pull up that chair,”
Mrs. Fordyce added, resuming her seat. “My husband
and I went to the Orient shortly after her
letter, and gradually my correspondence with your
mother ceased; but I have many happy memories of
our school days. Perhaps you have heard her
speak of me&mdash;Flora McPherson?”</p>

<p>“Of course, how stupid of me!” exclaimed Marjorie,
suddenly enlightened. “Mother often told me
of your pranks at boarding-school.”</p>

<p>“I was well and strong in those days.” A slight
sigh escaped Mrs. Fordyce. “This curvature of the
spine developed from injuries received in a railroad
wreck. Your mother would never recognize her
old play-fellow now;” a suspicious moisture dimmed
her eyes, and she added hastily, “Throw off your
wraps, my dear, and make yourself comfortable.
I want to have a long talk with you.”</p>

<p>Obediently Marjorie threw back her furs and
loosened her coat, as a velvet-footed servant entered
with the tea-tray and placed it on the table by Mrs.
Fordyce, and deftly arranged the cups and saucers.
He left the room to return in a moment carrying a
“Curate’s delight” filled with plates of delicious
sandwiches and cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“How will you have your tea?” asked Mrs. Fordyce,
removing the cover from the Dutch silver
caddy and placing some of the leaves in the teapot
while she waited for the water to boil in the kettle.</p>

<p>“Moderately strong, one lump of sugar, and
lemon,” replied Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Our tastes are similar; I hope it’s a good omen,”
smiled Mrs. Fordyce. “Try some of these sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“How did you discover that I am the daughter
of your old friend?” inquired Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Nicholas McIntyre, who was at Emma
Willard’s school at the same time your mother and
I were boarders there, told me of you. She admires
you greatly.”</p>

<p>“Bless her heart!” ejaculated Marjorie warmly.
“She has been lovely to me since mother’s death. I
didn’t know she had returned to Washington.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she has. I met her in New York
just before coming here, and she advised me&mdash;&mdash;”
she broke off abruptly. “How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I have just passed my twenty-fourth birthday.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look a day over eighteen.” Mrs. Fordyce
frowned perplexedly at the singing teakettle.
“Mrs. McIntyre said you were private secretary to
Admiral Lawrence....”</p>

<p>“I have been,” interrupted Marjorie, “but I am
with him no longer.”</p>

<p>“Then you could come to me&mdash;but”&mdash;checking
herself. “You are so young&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why should my age, or lack of it, be a bar to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>my doing secretary work?” questioned Marjorie,
looking in puzzled surprise at her hostess. “I write
a fair hand, I am a moderately good stenographer
and typewriter, and if you need a social secretary....”</p>

<p>“But I don’t require a secretary,” said Mrs. Fordyce.
“I want an official chaperon for my daughter,
Janet.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The ejaculation escaped Marjorie unwittingly,
and she flushed slightly, fearing the older
woman might be displeased by her open astonishment.
But Mrs. Fordyce, teacup poised in air, sat
gazing intently at her, oblivious of her confusion.
Apparently what she saw pleased her, for she came
to a sudden resolution.</p>

<p>“I am going to make you a proposition,” she
began, and Marjorie’s hopes rose. “My infirmity
prevents my accepting formal invitations, so I cannot
accompany my daughter to entertainments. I
do not want Janet to go alone, nor do I wish her
to be dependent on the kindness of friends to see
that she has a good time. I expected to find you
older; however, on second’s thought, that doesn’t
matter so much. Janet would far rather have a companion
than a stately dowager as chaperon. Will
you accept the position?”</p>

<p>“What will be my&mdash;my duties?” stammered Marjorie,
somewhat overwhelmed at the task offered her.</p>

<p>“To accompany Janet to dances, the theater, and
call with her, and preside at any entertainments we
may give for her. See that she meets the right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>people, and wears the proper clothes,” wound up
Mrs. Fordyce. “Your salary will be a hundred and
fifty dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Fordyce, that’s entirely too much,” protested
Marjorie, aghast.</p>

<p>“You will earn it,” retorted Mrs. Fordyce. “The
demands on your time will be very great. Come
to think of it, I believe you had better spend the
winter here with us.”</p>

<p>“Here? In this house?” Marjorie’s eyes grew
big with wonder. “I&mdash;I don’t believe I could leave
Aunt Yvonett&mdash;&mdash;” she stopped abruptly. After all
her aunt would not be alone; Cousin Rebekah Graves
would take most watchful care of her; she would
not be greatly missed at the little house in Thirteenth
Street, in fact, it would mean one mouth less to feed.
With such a salary, she could turn over fully a
hundred and twenty-five dollars a month to her aunt;
the money would be sorely needed now that the
bank’s failure had carried away Madame Yvonett’s
small hoard.</p>

<p>If she accepted Mrs. Fordyce’s offer, her lines
would fall in pleasant places. Marjorie glanced with
increasing satisfaction about the large, well-proportioned
room with its costly hangings, handsome furniture,
and rare bric-a-brac. She was a bit of a
Sybarite, and the beautiful things, the outward and
visible signs of wealth about her, satisfied that craving.
To go to dances, theaters, and dinners&mdash;what
more could a girl want?</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered back to Mrs. Fordyce, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>sat patiently awaiting her decision. Except for the
ugly, curved back, the older woman, in her dainty
teagown, might have been a piece of Dresden china,
so pink and white were her unwrinkled cheeks, and
her features finely chiseled. Her dark, delicately
arched eyebrows were in sharp contrast to her snow-white
hair. Mrs. Fordyce had a simplicity and
charm of manner which endeared her to high and
low. As Marjorie encountered the full gaze of her
handsome eyes, she almost cried out, so much pathos
and hidden tragedy was in their dark depths. She
rose impulsively to her feet.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fordyce,” she said, “I will gladly accept,
but&mdash;&mdash;wait,” she stumbled in her speech. “Admiral
Lawrence dismissed me this morning because&mdash;because
a valuable paper was missing.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“Did you steal the paper?” asked Mrs. Fordyce
quietly. Marjorie winced, but her eyes never
wavered before the other’s calm regard.</p>

<p>“No.” The monosyllable was clear and unfaltering.
“But Admiral Lawrence believes I did.”</p>

<p>Marjorie found the lengthening silence intolerable.
Her hands crept up to her coat and she buttoned
it, then she commenced putting on her gloves.</p>

<p>“When can you come to me?” inquired Mrs. Fordyce
finally.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you want me?” Marjorie advanced a
step, half-incredulous. “After what I’ve just told
you?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you good woman!” With a swift, graceful
movement Marjorie stooped and laid her lips to the
blue-veined hand resting on the chair arm.</p>

<p>“I flatter myself I’m a woman of some perception,”
replied Mrs. Fordyce, coloring warmly. “And
truth doesn’t always lie at the bottom of a well.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later all details of her engagement
as chaperon were satisfactorily settled, and bidding
Mrs. Fordyce a warm good-night, Marjorie, lighter
hearted than she had been in many a day, tripped
down the hall and through the front door held open
by a deferential footman. As she gained the sidewalk
a limousine turned in under the porte-cochère
and stopped before the door she had just left. Pausing
to readjust her furs, she saw a familiar figure
spring out of the motor, and a well-known voice
said clearly:</p>

<p>“Look out for that step, Miss Fordyce,” and
Chichester Barnard caught his companion’s arm in
time to save her from a fall as she descended from
the motor.</p>

<p>Marjorie watched them enter the lighted vestibule,
her thoughts in riot. Chichester Barnard’s
“business engagement” had not prevented his dancing
attendance upon another girl&mdash;and she, Marjorie
Langdon, was to be that girl’s official chaperon.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“D</span>oes</span> everything look in order in the dining-room,
Duncan?” inquired Mrs. Fordyce
anxiously, on her son’s entrance, laying
down the magazine she was reading.</p>

<p>“Of course it is, dear mother,” he replied, sitting
down on the lounge beside her. “You can always
trust Perkins to arrange the table decorations to
the Queen’s taste. Why so anxious tonight?”</p>

<p>“It is our first dinner-party in Washington, and
I want everything to go off well for Janet’s sake.
First impressions count for so much.”</p>

<p>Duncan laughed outright. “You, mother, worrying
about a simple dinner of sixteen? Your Beacon
Street ancestors will disown you.”</p>

<p>“My dear, Beacon Street traditions and Washington
etiquette have to assimilate slowly. The official
and diplomatic life here presents many pitfalls for
the unwary, and Janet is young....”</p>

<p>“But you have provided her with a chaperon.”
Duncan yawned as he arranged his white tie.</p>

<p>“The chaperon isn’t any too old,” confessed Mrs.
Fordyce. She had not taken her family entirely
into her confidence in referring to Marjorie, contenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
herself with mentioning the fact, two days before,
that she had engaged a chaperon for Janet, a
statement which raised a storm of protest on that
young débutante’s part.</p>

<p>“Then why in the world did you engage her?”
asked Duncan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fordyce debated the question. “Mrs.
McIntyre assured me she was altogether charming,
and most popular. She said she knew Washington’s
complex social system to a dot....”</p>

<p>“And we are to supply the dash?” Duncan
shrugged his broad shoulders. “Apparently you have
secured a domestic treasure; well, your plan may
work out all right, but, mother, I don’t like the idea
of your retiring so much from social life.”</p>

<p>“With my infirmity I cannot face strangers; don’t
ask me, dear.”</p>

<p>“Mother! As if anyone ever thinks of that after
they have once met you,” exclaimed Duncan, greatly
touched by the unuttered grief in Mrs. Fordyce’s
eyes, and he gave her an impulsive hug.</p>

<p>“Here, here, this will never do,” protested a
hearty voice from the other end of the boudoir.
“Duncan, my boy, do you realize there are
young ‘buds’ downstairs waiting for your fond
embraces?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” retorted Duncan undutifully.</p>

<p>“Are our guests arriving, Calderon?” asked Mrs.
Fordyce in some alarm. “And you are not in the
drawing-room?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they haven’t come just yet,” admitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>her husband. “Don’t take me too literally, Flora.
Where did you pick up the chaperon?”</p>

<p>“She came to me highly recommended,” said Mrs.
Fordyce, her placid manner undisturbed. “You
were not in town, Calderon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As if that would have made any difference?”
he chuckled. “My dearest, your wish is law in this
house; if you want a dozen chaperons you shall
have them. I predict, Duncan,” turning to his son
who had risen and was lazily stretching himself,
“that with Janet and her chaperon on deck, we shall
have a lively winter.”</p>

<p>“Back to the wilds for me!” retorted Duncan.
“Tell me, mother, did your chaperon pick out our
guests tonight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; Janet selected the young girls and men
who have already shown her attention, the invitations
were sent out over ten days ago. You see, in
place of giving a big reception to introduce Janet, I
plan to have a series of weekly dinner-dances.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of your paragon?” asked
Duncan.</p>

<p>“Marjorie Langdon, her mother was an old school
friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“The name sounds familiar,” Duncan wrinkled
his brow in puzzled thought.</p>

<p>“Go down and meet her and then you’ll be certain
about it,” put in his father. “Now, Flora, will you
give me your attention....”</p>

<p>Taking the hint Duncan strode to the door and
vanished. As he reached the head of the staircase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>he heard his name called, and turning around, saw
Janet standing before the elevator shaft. He retraced
his steps and joined her, and they entered the
lift together.</p>

<p>“How do I look, Duncan?” she asked eagerly,
turning slowly around for his inspection, as the automatic
car shot downward.</p>

<p>“The gown’s all right; the worst piece is in the
middle,” he teased, glancing admiringly at her blond
prettiness. She was dressed in exquisite taste, and her
suddenly acquired grown-up manner sat quaintly upon
her. Her slightly offended expression caused him to
add hastily: “I like your hair arranged that way.”</p>

<p>“I do think it’s becoming,” admitted Janet, twisting
about in the lift so as to catch a better glimpse
of herself in the tiny mirror. “Marjorie Langdon
dressed it for me. Do you know, Duncan, I believe
I’m going to like her.”</p>

<p>He was saved from comment by the stopping of
the lift, and Janet, her dignity flying to the four
winds, scampered over to the drawing-room. Duncan
followed her more slowly, and paused abruptly at the
threshold of the room on perceiving a tall girl arranging
roses in a vase, on one of the empire tables.</p>

<p>Marjorie Langdon belonged to a type which appears
to greater advantage in evening dress than in
street costume, and with half-cynical, wholly critical
eyes Duncan studied the girl, who, unaware of his
presence, stood with her profile turned toward him.
In her shimmering white gown, which suited her perfectly,
and her color heightened by the excitement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>of her first official appearance in the Fordyce house,
she was well worth a second look.</p>

<p>“Lord! she needs a chaperon herself,” Duncan
muttered under his breath, then stepped toward her
as Marjorie looked in his direction. “I shall have
to present myself, Miss Langdon&mdash;Duncan Fordyce,”
he said pleasantly. “My sister Janet is too
much excited to remember the formalities.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” broke in Janet from the window
seat. “I thought you two had met.”</p>

<p>Successfully concealing her surprise under a
friendly smile, Marjorie shook his hand cordially;
until that moment she had not known of Duncan
Fordyce’s existence. “When did you come to Washington?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>“Three days ago&mdash;&mdash;” the arrival of his father
and several other men interrupted his speech.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the last guest had arrived, and
Duncan, keeping up a detached conversation with a
nervous débutante, watched Marjorie with increasing
interest. Her youth might be against her as a
chaperon, but her poise and good breeding left nothing
to be desired. No sign of awkwardness was discernible
in her manner as she stood by Janet’s side
assisting her in receiving the guests, and Calderon
Fordyce, stopping beside his son, whispered a vehement:
“She’ll do.” His attention distracted, Duncan
failed to see one guest’s quickly concealed astonishment
on beholding Marjorie standing beside Janet.</p>

<p>“You here!” exclaimed Chichester Barnard.
“How&mdash;how&mdash;delightful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Marjorie gently. “I think,
Chichester, you are to take out our hostess,
Miss Fordyce,” as the butler and footman parted
the portières. “Ah, Baron von Valkenberg, am I
your fate? Suppose we wait until the others have
gone out,” and she stepped back, the diplomat at
her side.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the ices, Marjorie permitted
herself a second’s relaxation, and sat back in her
chair. Both her neighbors were busily engaged in
conversation with the young girls sitting on the
other side of them, and glad of the respite, she
glanced about the table. She had been talking incessantly
since the commencement of dinner and her
vocal chords actually ached. Everyone seemed to
be having a gay time, there was no lull in the conversation.
Marjorie took in the handsome silver
and glass table appointments, and the beautiful
flower centerpiece with secret satisfaction; the dinner
and the service had been irreproachable. In fact,
the ease and quiet elegance of the dinner recalled
her own mother’s delightful hospitality before they
lost their money. Marjorie sighed involuntarily;
then her lips stiffened resolutely. She had, on thinking
over Mrs. Fordyce’s proposal, decided to back
out of her engagement, but Madame Yvonett, delighted
with the plan, refused to permit her to withdraw
her acceptance, and bag and baggage she had
arrived at the Fordyce residence at five o’clock that
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to give me a word?” inquired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>Duncan, her left-hand neighbor, turning abruptly to
her. “All I’ve seen of you is a pink ear. Baron von
Valkenberg has monopolized you outrageously.”</p>

<p>“He is a stranger,” replied Marjorie laughing.
“He has only been in this country five weeks; I’ve
been trying to make him feel at home.”</p>

<p>“A very laudable object; but I’m a stranger, too,”
protested Duncan. “You might be nice to me.”</p>

<p>“But you <i>are</i> at home,” Marjorie’s smile was one
of her greatest charms, and Duncan, all unconscious,
fell under its spell. “Is this your first visit to Washington?”</p>

<p>“No. When at Yale I used to spend my vacations
here with Mrs. McIntyre. That was ten years ago.
Do you know, at the two entertainments I’ve been
to already, I saw some of the people I met here
then, and they knew me.”</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised; Washington is a place where
one is never missed and never forgotten. Where
have you been since leaving Yale?”</p>

<p>“Knocking about the world,” carelessly. “I’ve
just come up from Panama. Who’s the good-looking
man sitting on my sister’s right?”</p>

<p>“Chichester Barnard.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The name struck a chord of memory, and
the scene at the Turkish bath three days before
flashed before Duncan and he frowned. Some
telepathy seemed to tell Barnard that he was
under discussion, and catching Marjorie’s eye
across the table, he raised his champagne glass
in gay challenge. She lifted hers to her lips in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>response, and set it down untasted. “He’s remarkably
fine looking,” reiterated Duncan. “Something
Byronic about him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Marjorie; then turned abruptly to
Baron von Valkenberg, who, having refused the
sweets, had been for the past five minutes reaching
under the table in a manner which suggested the loss
of his napkin. “What’s the matter, Baron?”</p>

<p>The young diplomat straightened up suddenly, and
gravely replied: “I sink it is a flea.”</p>

<p>For a moment gravity was at a discount, then
Marjorie, catching Janet’s eye, rose, and the guests
and their hostess trooped back into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The men wasted but a short time over their cigars
and liqueur, and soon the dancing in the ballroom
was in full swing. It was after midnight when
Chichester Barnard approached Marjorie and asked
for a dance. There was a barely perceptible pause,
then, with a word of thanks to her former partner,
she laid her hand on Barnard’s arm, and they floated
out on the floor. They were two of the best dancers
in Washington, and Duncan, dancing with Janet,
watched them with an odd feeling of unrest. They
had circled the room but twice when Barnard stopped
near the entrance to the library.</p>

<p>“I must talk to you, Madge,” he whispered hurriedly.
“Come in here,” and he led the way to a
comfortable leather-covered divan. They had the
room to themselves. “Why didn’t you consult me
before coming here as chaperon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Because I did not think my affairs interested you
further.”</p>

<p>“Madge!” The soft, caressing voice held a note
of keen reproach. “How can you so misjudge me?”</p>

<p>But she refused to be placated. “It’s some days
since I have seen you,” she replied wearily. “How is
your aunt, Mrs. Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“About the same, I believe,” shortly. “Tell me,
how did you come to give up your secretary work
there?”</p>

<p>“You ask me that?” A sparkle of anger darkened
Marjorie’s eyes, and he glanced uncomfortably
at the mantel clock. “You are better informed as
to what transpires in the Lawrence home than I
am.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he complained.
“Admiral Lawrence has a grudge against me, witness
his advising my aunt to cut me out of her will;
and now I believe he has influenced you to turn
against me. Madge, it’s not like you to go back on
a pal,” he added bitterly.</p>

<p>“I am not the one who has ‘gone back,’” she
retorted with spirit. “And I think it’s best, all things
considered, to return you this”&mdash;taking a heavy gold
signet ring out of a fold of her bodice and placing
it in his hand.</p>

<p>He looked at it in stupefied silence for a moment,
then threw it contemptuously on the large library
table.</p>

<p>“Do you think by returning that ring that you can
break the tie that binds me to you, my darling?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>he cried, real feeling in voice and gesture. “That
bit of gold is but a symbol of my love&mdash;as long as
life lasts, my heart, my homage, are yours.” Her
pulse quickened under the ardor in his eyes. “God!
why am I poor!” He struck one fist impotently in
his other palm. “Cannot you understand, my darling,
that it hurts me cruelly to see you living here
as a paid chaperon when you should reign as queen.”</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon,” called Janet from the doorway.
“Our guests are waiting to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>Marjorie, dragged once more to earth, started
guiltily for the door, without a glance at her companion.
A chaperon had small right to sit in corners
with attractive men.</p>

<p>After the last guest had departed Marjorie, leaving
Janet and her father and brother discussing the
events of the evening, slipped back into the library.
But her search of the table and other pieces of furniture
was fruitless.</p>

<p>“In spite of his protests, he pocketed the ring,”
she muttered, and a queer smile crossed her lips.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT FORT MYER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“T</span>his</span> way, sir; your seats are in the upper
gallery,” announced a cavalry corporal.
“Right up here, miss,” and he assisted
Janet up the first steps of the narrow stairway, then
made way for Chichester Barnard who followed
her. “Let me see your tickets, please,” continued
the corporal as Duncan Fordyce appeared at his
elbow, Marjorie in his wake. “Very sorry, sir, but
these seats are in the north gallery at the other end
of the riding-hall. You’ll have to go outside to get
there, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thundering devils!” ejaculated Duncan, taking
back the two pink pasteboards. “Mrs. Walbridge
sold mother these four tickets. I supposed the seats
were all together. Wait here just a minute, Miss
Marjorie, and I’ll run out to the ticket agent and
see if I can’t exchange these seats for others on this
side of the hall.”</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded a cheerful assent, and in Duncan’s
absence watched the new arrivals swarming
into the building. The annual drill, given under the
auspices of the Woman’s Army Relief Society, was
a great event, not only at Fort Myer but in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>National Capital and Georgetown as well, and fashionable
society had apparently turned out en masse
to attend it.</p>

<p>“Splendid success, Marjorie,” boomed a voice
close to her ear, and turning she recognized Mrs.
Walbridge, majestic in her ermine coat and nearly
two hundred pounds avoirdupois. “The ticket committee
told me the President and most of his Cabinet
will be here. The hall is sold out. Haven’t you
a seat, child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am waiting for&mdash;&mdash;” the name was lost
in the slamming down of chairs and the stamping of
feet.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” exclaimed Mrs. Walbridge,
much relieved. “I couldn’t have you stand. Be sure
and bring your escort over to the Administration
Building for tea after the drill,” and she moved
ponderously down the aisle to her seat.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have been so long,” apologized Duncan,
rejoining Marjorie. “I succeeded in exchanging my
tickets for two seats in this lower section. Come
on,” but Marjorie held back, and her face grew
troubled.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t I better go upstairs and sit with your
sister, and let Mr. Barnard join you in these lower
seats?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You take your chaperonage too seriously,”
declared Duncan firmly. “I hardly ever see you
alone, Miss Marjorie, and now Fate has given me
a chance to enjoy myself, I decline to have your
New England conscience spoil my fun. But if it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>will make you feel any easier, I’ll run up and tell
Barnard where we are sitting. Here, Corporal,
show this lady to her chair,” and he turned and
dashed upstairs.</p>

<p>Marjorie slowly followed the non-commissioned
officer down the aisle to the front row, speaking to
her different friends as she passed them. As she
made herself comfortable in the narrow chair, she
recognized Baron von Valkenberg and the military
attaches of the foreign embassies at Washington,
always interested spectators at the drills, sitting near
her. To her left was the box reserved for the President
and the Commandant of the Post, draped with
the President’s personal flag and the Stars and
Stripes, while the Chief of Staff and his aides occupied
an adjoining box.</p>

<p>Duncan saw Janet and Barnard sitting midway
in the front row of the gallery, and with many apologies
to the occupants of the chairs whose feet
he encountered on his way to them, he reached
Barnard’s side, and in a few words explained the
situation, then, not waiting for comment, turned
and ran downstairs, reaching Marjorie’s side just
as the opening bars of the National Anthem echoed
through the hall, and the entire audience rose as the
President stepped into his box.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it grand!” shouted Janet to Barnard,
clapping her hands as a troop of cavalry rode on
to the tanbark, and with a ringing cheer, swept at
a run down the hall straight to the President’s box,
their chargers’ noses stopping just short of the high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>railing, and their sabers flashing in salute; then the
drill was on.</p>

<p>So absorbed was Janet in the different events
scheduled that her companion received but scant attention.</p>

<p>“I declare, our soldiers are magnificent!” Janet
drew a long breath, and regretfully watched the
company of picked roughriders leave the hall.</p>

<p>“You little enthusiast!” Barnard’s handsome
eyes glowed with some warmer sentiment than mere
approval as he studied her piquant face. “Jove!
It’s a liberal education to know you.”</p>

<p>“Now you are making fun of me,” she said reproachfully,
her foot beating time to the stirring
tune the post band was playing across the hall.</p>

<p>“I never was more in earnest.” The two heads
were bent very close together, and the tender timbre
of his voice made her heart beat quicker. “You
have no idea, little girl, of the influence you unconsciously
exert on those about you. Please God,
I’m a better, cleaner man for having known you; only
having known you&mdash;&mdash;” his whisper reached her ear
alone&mdash;“life will never be the same unless you are
with me&mdash;always!” She stirred uneasily, frightened
by the vehemence of his manner. “Surely you
guessed,” he whispered, bending down so that she
looked directly at him. His nearness, his comeliness,
held her.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;don’t know!” she slid one trembling hand
in his. “I know you better than any other man. I
think of you&mdash;often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>His face lightened with hope. “I’ll make you
love me,” and pretending to pick up the program, he
stooped and pressed his lips to her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” she stammered. “Suppose Duncan
should see you.”</p>

<p>“I am willing that he should,” Barnard smiled
happily. “But don’t worry, your brother is too attentive
in another quarter to bother about us.”</p>

<p>“Duncan attentive?” in sharp surprise. “To
whom?”</p>

<p>But Barnard’s eyes had wandered to the high
jumping going on below them and apparently he did
not hear the question. “He’s down!” he shouted as
horse and rider plunged headlong to the ground, and
for a time he and Janet watched the jumping in
absolute silence.</p>

<p>“How do you like your chaperon?” he asked
finally.</p>

<p>“Marjorie? Very much, indeed. Father and
mother think she is splendid, and she has been just
lovely to me. I don’t know how I could have gotten
through this month without her.”</p>

<p>“Good; I’m delighted to hear she’s such a success,”
he exclaimed heartily. “To be candid, I was
afraid the experiment wouldn’t work. Marjorie is
not always easy to get along with; she just lost an
awfully good job before your mother engaged her.
And Marjorie’s so blessed poor, she needs every cent
she can make.”</p>

<p>“It is fine the way she helps Madame Yvonett,”
said Janet with genuine enthusiasm. “Marjorie took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>me to see her aunt, and I think she is a darling. I
met her cousin there, Captain Nichols&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t think he’s a darling also?” in
mock jealousy.</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd!” But a warm color mantled
Janet’s face, and to cover her confusion she examined
the program. “Oh, I see it is his battery
that is to drill this afternoon....”</p>

<p>“And here they come now,” broke in Barnard; a
trumpet call drowned his words.</p>

<p>Tom Nichols, looking every inch a soldier, rode
at the head of his battery and, after saluting the
President, backed his horse to the side of the hall
and took up his station there, followed by his trumpeter.
Janet, her pulses dancing with excitement,
leaned far over the balcony, and watched the battery
drill, that most stirring of spectacles, with breathless
attention. If her eyes stole now and then from the
racing mounted cannoniers, the plunging horses, and
leaping gun-carriages to a soldierly figure sitting
erect and watchful on a restive charger, no one, not
even Barnard, was aware of it.</p>

<p>The two other members of their party sitting
in the gallery beneath them, had been almost
as absorbed in the exhibition drill as Janet and
Barnard.</p>

<p>“Tired?” inquired Duncan, turning to Marjorie.
She had watched each thrilling performance in silent
enjoyment, replying mostly in monosyllables to his
few remarks, and Duncan, slowly learning to divine
her moods and tenses, had been content to sit quietly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>by her side, only occasionally stealing covert glances
in her direction.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” she protested. “I feel ‘abominably
refreshed,’ as Aunt Yvonett puts it. Is the drill
over?”</p>

<p>“Apparently so.” Duncan rose and Marjorie followed
his example. “Stand here out of the crowd,”
he suggested a moment later as they approached the
entrance. “We can see Janet and Barnard as they
come down.” But the crowd had thinned materially,
and the band was playing its last stirring quick-step,
before the others put in their appearance.</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry to be so long,” apologized Barnard,
holding open the large swing door for Marjorie
to pass through. “Where to now?”</p>

<p>“There’s a tea-dance at the Administration Building,”
began Marjorie. “Shall we go over there?”</p>

<p>“I have a better plan than that,” put in a voice
behind her, and Tom Nichols joined the little group.
“Come and have tea with me; I am particularly
anxious to have you see my quarters.” The invitation
was addressed to Marjorie and her companions,
but Tom’s eyes sought Janet, and impulsively she responded
to their mute pleading.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll come,” and slipping her hand
inside Marjorie’s arm, she kept step with Tom as
he piloted them across the parade grounds. Duncan
paused long enough to direct his chauffeur to bring
the limousine to Captain Nichols’ quarters, then hastened
after them. With no little pride Tom ushered
his guests into his semi-detached house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Let me help you off with your coat, Miss Fordyce,”
he said, but he was too late; Barnard was
already assisting her. Slightly discomforted Tom
turned back to Marjorie, only to find she had stepped
into the parlor, and was gazing into the lighted
dining-room which opened out of it.</p>

<p>“Are you a magician, Tom?” she asked.
“Here is your table all set for tea, and you only
knew three minutes ago that we were coming.”</p>

<p>Tom reddened under his tan. “I hoped you would
come; Miss Fordyce told me at the Army and Navy
Club last night that she had tickets for the drill.”
Janet, scenting a discussion, hurried into the parlor,
followed by her brother and Barnard. “Besides,”
added Tom, with honest intent, but stumbling over
his speech. “I&mdash;eh&mdash;gave a&mdash;eh&mdash;half invitation to
Joe Cooper to bring his mother and sister&mdash;there
they are now,” and he hastened into the reception
hall as the electric bell buzzed.</p>

<p>Marjorie stifled an impatient sigh; she did not
like the Calhoun-Coopers. The dislike was mutual.
They had tried assiduously to cultivate the Fordyces,
and Marjorie’s veiled opposition to any intimacy
between Pauline Calhoun-Cooper and Janet had
aroused their silent enmity.</p>

<p>“Mother was very sorry not to be able to come,”
announced a penetrating voice in the hall. “It was
too sweet of you to ask us. Is this your parlor?”
and the portières were pulled back, admitting a
strikingly gowned young woman whose good looks
were slightly marred by a discontented expression.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>“Dear Miss Fordyce, so glad to see you,” she gushed.
“And of course, Miss Langdon,” but the latter
handshake was perfunctory, and Pauline turned with
added warmth to greet Duncan and Barnard. Joe
Calhoun-Cooper was more quiet in his entrance, and
Tom was leading his guests into the dining-room
before Duncan noticed his presence. Barnard, lingering
in the background, observed Duncan’s curt
nod and Joe’s darkening face, and his curiosity was
instantly aroused. It was the first time Joe had
met Duncan since their encounter in the dormitory
of the Turkish Bath, Joe having been in New York,
but he had neither forgotten nor forgiven Duncan
for his plain speech that day, and the physical force
with which he had punctuated his meaning.</p>

<p>“Will you take charge of the tea, Madge?” asked
Tom, pulling out the chair at the head of the table.
“I hope everything is here,” anxiously examining
the bountifully supplied table. “Let me draw up
a chair for you, Miss Fordyce.” Then turning to
the others. “Do make yourselves comfortable,” he
entreated.</p>

<p>Duncan found himself sandwiched in between
Pauline and her brother, Joe, and at some distance
from Marjorie. He was spared the trouble of
making small talk, for Pauline took that matter
into her own hands, and kept up a running fire of
comment which required only an occasional answer.
To his great annoyance he discovered that Barnard
and Marjorie were holding an animated, low-toned
conversation, and Barnard’s manner was becoming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>more intense as the slow minutes passed. Pauline
finally observed which way Duncan’s attention was
straying, and her black eyes snapped with anger.</p>

<p>“They make a very handsome couple,” she whispered
confidentially, nodding toward Marjorie.
“An old affair....”</p>

<p>Duncan favored her with a blank, noncommittal
stare, while inwardly furious. “Ah, indeed,”
vaguely, then in a voice which made his sister jump,
he called out: “Nice quarters you have, Nichols.”</p>

<p>“Mighty glad you like them, old man,” replied
Tom, beaming with pleasure. “Marjorie came over
here when I first moved in and helped me settle the
house. She deserves all the praise.”</p>

<p>“I do not,” contradicted Marjorie, breaking off
her tête-à-tête with Barnard, and Duncan sat back
well satisfied. “Aunt Yvonett is responsible for your
home.”</p>

<p>“I never knew before that bachelors had so much
furniture,” chimed in Pauline.</p>

<p>“They don’t,” replied Tom. “Most of this stuff,”
waving his hand vaguely toward the heavy pieces
of furniture, “belongs to the Government.”</p>

<p>“How long is your detail here?” asked Barnard.</p>

<p>“There is no specified limit, but we are expecting
to be ordered to another station very shortly.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d hate to give up all this
furniture when you move away,” commented Janet,
looking admiringly about the cozy room.</p>

<p>“I’ll find some exactly like it in the officers’ quarters
at my next post,” carelessly. “Uncle Sam partly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>furnishes all the houses on Government Reservations,
you know. What I shall miss will be Washington.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the War Department will extend your
detail here,” exclaimed Marjorie hopefully.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” groaned Tom. “Now, in the
good old days ... I suppose you have all heard
of the marine officer who was stationed for so many
years at the marine barracks in Washington, that
when he died he bequeathed his Government quarters
in the Yard to his daughters in his will, thinking
it belonged to him.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to leave Washington, Tom,
why don’t you chuck the service?” asked Joe. “You
are a bloated plutocrat now.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean, Tom?” demanded Marjorie
quickly. “Have you inherited money?”</p>

<p>“No. Shut up, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Well, with your luck anything might happen,”
protested Joe. “If you don’t resign they may make
you a major-general.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” Tom looked as provoked as he felt.
“Let me explain Joe’s nonsense. When in Brussels
two years ago, I attended the Vieux Marché where
the townspeople and peasants bring old junk on Sundays
to be sold for what it will bring, and I picked
up an old coin for five centimes. The other day I
heard Admiral Lawrence discussing numismatology
in the club, and it occurred to me to show my coin
to an antique dealer. Joe went with me yesterday,
and I’m blessed if the dealer didn’t tell me the coin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>was worth between twelve and fifteen hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how romantic!” ejaculated Pauline, and
Janet looked her interest.</p>

<p>“Let’s see the coin, Tom,” suggested Joe, “or
have you sold it?”</p>

<p>“No, the dealer only gave me the address of a
New York coin collector whom he thought would
buy it. If you really care to see the coin,” looking
anxiously at Janet, who nodded her head vigorously.
“Just a moment, I’ll run upstairs and get it.”</p>

<p>Pauline promptly opened a lively conversation
with Barnard across the table, and Duncan was just
thinking of changing his seat when Tom rejoined
them carrying a small pasteboard box.</p>

<p>“There, isn’t that an ugly thing to be worth all
that gold,” he said, placing the coin in Janet’s hand,
and the others crowded about to get a better look
at it.</p>

<p>“There’s no accounting for taste,” admitted Janet,
handing it back to Tom. “Personally I’d rather
buy....”</p>

<p>A long blue flame shot out from under the teakettle,
and Marjorie jumped from her seat in alarm.</p>

<p>“Lord! the alcohol lamp’s busted,” shouted Tom,
dropping the pasteboard box on the sideboard, and
reaching over he seized the boiling kettle and its
nickel frame. “Open the window, Fordyce,” and he
tossed the burning lamp out on the ground where
it exploded harmlessly. “Were you burned,
Madge?” he asked, returning to her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, only frightened; the flame shot at me
so suddenly.” Marjorie passed a nervous hand
over her mouth, conscious that her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>“I really think we must be leaving,” broke in
Pauline. She did not like having attention diverted
from herself, and playing second fiddle to a girl
who worked for her living was too novel a sensation
to be agreeable. “We’ve had a delightful time, Captain;
good-bye everybody,” and she sailed out of the
room, accompanied by her flurried host and her
brother.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to hurry you, Janet, but we must be
going also,” said Marjorie quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s later than I thought,” responded the
younger girl. “Gracious, I entirely forgot we are
going to the theater tonight.”</p>

<p>“We will all meet there,” Barnard helped Janet
into her coat with solicitous care. “Nichols and I
are both invited by Judge and Mrs. Walbridge.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Tom, we’ve had an awfully good
time,” Marjorie gave her cousin’s hand an affectionate
squeeze as he helped her into the limousine.
The Calhoun-Coopers’ car was already a dim speck
in the distance.</p>

<p>“Good-bye&mdash;see you all tonight,” shouted Tom,
and watched the limousine out of sight. On re-entering
the house he was on the point of going upstairs
when he remembered the coin. Retracing his footsteps
he went to the sideboard in the dining-room
and opened the box. It was empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Tom glanced in deep perplexity at the box, and
then about the room. He had a very distinct recollection
of stuffing the coin back into the box just as
the flame from the lamp leaped out, and of dropping
the closed box on the sideboard. There had been
only himself and his guests in the house, for he had
sent his striker over to assist at the tea-dance at the
Administration Building, after first setting his master’s
tea table.</p>

<p>Tom went rapidly through all his pockets; then
searched the room, then the parlor; next he went
into the servants’ quarters and, as he expected, found
them empty. From there he went over the house,
but he was the only person in it, and the windows
and doors were all securely locked. Convinced of
that fact, he returned to the dining-room, and
dropped bewildered into the nearest chair. His eyes
fell on the uptilted cardboard box; there was even
a slight impress left on the cotton where the coin had
lain.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” exclaimed Tom aloud. “Really
gone!” And his face was as blank as the opposite

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>inerva</span> glared at her image in the glass
she was polishing with unusual diligence.
“A cleanin’ an’ a cleanin’,” she exclaimed
rebelliously. “Miss Rebekah don’t hardly ’low me
time ter eat. Miss Marjorie didn’t never turn me
inter a&mdash;a&mdash;flyin’ squadron”&mdash;Minerva hadn’t the
faintest idea of the meaning of “flying squadron,”
but she had picked up the words while waiting at
table, and they sounded big enough to express her
state of mind. “An’ I ain’t gwine ter church termorro’,
nohow; las’ time I went, I come home an’
foun’ Miss Rebekah had done took all my china
an’ glass off de pantry shelves, an’ I had ter put it
back. What kind ob a Christian am she, anyhow?
An’ when I’m down on my marrow bones a scrubbin’
de flo’, she flops down an’ keeps me a prayin’ fo’
five minutes. Lan’ sakes! dar’s de bell.” Hastily
washing her hands and putting a white apron over
her gingham one, she took her leisurely way to the
front door.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Marse Tom?” she exclaimed, showing
all her ivories in an expansive smile on seeing the
young officer standing in the vestibule. “De Madam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>will be mighty glad ter see yo’; step right inter de
pawlor, I’ll go tell her yo’ am hyar.”</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett found Tom walking restlessly
up and down the small room when she entered a
few minutes later.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to see thee, Thomas,” she said,
kissing him warmly. “Thee finds us rather topsy-turvey;
this is cleaning day, but make thyself comfortable,
I will sit here,” selecting her customary
high back arm-chair, and producing her knitting.</p>

<p>Tom established himself in one end of the rosewood
sofa.</p>

<p>“You must miss Marjorie awfully,” he said, inspecting
the disarranged room with some wonder.</p>

<p>“I do;” an involuntary sigh escaped Madame
Yvonett. “Marjorie is young, but she understands
the foibles of the old; she is a good child.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Cousin Rebekah Graves is a bit too
strenuous for you.”</p>

<p>“Becky’s a trifle breezy, but anything’s better
than a dead calm,” responded the Quakeress. “I
am pleased that Marjorie is with the Fordyces; from
what she says they must be charming people.”</p>

<p>“They are,” declared Tom with such positiveness
that a faint gleam of amusement lit his companion’s
eyes. “Has Marjorie been in to see you today?”</p>

<p>“No. She usually comes about this time on her
return from market. Thee knows Mrs. Fordyce has
turned the housekeeping over to her.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me they put a great deal on Marjorie....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Tut! Marjorie’s shoulders are young and broad.
It would be better if the younger generation carried
more responsibilities; too much is done for them by
their elders. In my day”&mdash;dropping her knitting
in her lap as she warmed to her subject&mdash;“the development
of character went hand-in-hand with education;
now, education is founded on indulgence.
The modern child must be amused, spoiled, its fits
of temper condoned....”</p>

<p>“Spare the rod and spoil the child,” quoted Tom,
in open amusement.</p>

<p>“A sound doctrine,” affirmed Madame Yvonett
with spirit. “And if the American nation is to endure,
character in the child must be cultivated.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot in what you say,” agreed Tom. “I
came in this morning hoping to see you alone;”
he rose and sat down close by her. “I am anxious
to consult you about an incident that occurred yesterday
afternoon in my quarters,” and in a few words
he described the disappearance of the coin.</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett listened with absorbed attention
to the story, and at its conclusion, sat back and gazed
unbelievingly at Tom, her busy needles idly suspended
in air.</p>

<p>“Does thee mean to say thee can find no trace of
the coin?” she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“It has disappeared absolutely.”</p>

<p>“Is thee certain that thy servant was not in the
house at the time the lamp exploded?”</p>

<p>“Positive. Mrs. Sims, wife of the Commandant,
told me he was assisting the other servants in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>Administration Building from the commencement of
the tea-dance until its close.”</p>

<p>“Then thee infers that one of thy guests stole the
coin?”</p>

<p>“What other conclusion can I reach?” hopelessly.
“And yet it’s a devilish thought.”</p>

<p>“Has thee suspicions against anyone in particular?”
Madame Yvonett paled as she put the question,
but she sat with her back to the light and Tom
did not perceive her agitation.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” reluctantly. “Joe Calhoun-Cooper.”</p>

<p>“Cooper? Ah, yes, I recollect; thee means John
C. Cooper’s grandson. What leads thee to suspect
him?”</p>

<p>“I know he’s hard up; he’s been trying to
borrow money, his father having shut down on
his allowance;” Tom paused thoughtfully, then
continued. “Joe was with me when I learned
the coin’s value. He first spoke of it yesterday&mdash;I
never should have mentioned the matter&mdash;and
suggested I show the coin to my guests, evidently
depending on chance to give him an opportunity to
steal it.”</p>

<p>“It dove-tails nicely,” acknowledged Madame
Yvonett. “In fact, too nicely; beware, Thomas, be
not hasty in thy judgment.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” doggedly. “Joe’s always been tricky,
even as a schoolboy.”</p>

<p>“Then how does it happen that thee associates
with him now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;eh&mdash;his family have been very decent to
me, and I’ve gone there a good bit.” Madame
Yvonett’s shrewd eyes twinkled. “While accepting
their hospitality I couldn’t refuse to know Joe.
Although I’ve never liked him, I knew no real
ground for dropping him, until now,” and Tom’s
pleasant face hardened.</p>

<p>“Does thee intend to prosecute him for the theft
of the coin?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t quite decided,” admitted Tom. “The
loss of such a sum of money means a good deal to
me; still, I have only the dealer’s word that the
coin was worth between twelve and fifteen hundred
dollars. I could have Joe arrested,” doubtfully.
“It’s a dirty business. Perhaps it would be better
to keep silent, but tell Joe to leave Washington or
I’ll expose his rascality.”</p>

<p>“Thee’ll have to secure more proof against him
to make that threat effective,” put in Madame
Yvonett, sagely.</p>

<p>“I’ve already written to the coin collector in New
York, describing my coin, and asking him to notify
me if such a coin is offered to him, and by whom.
Joe was with me when the dealer here gave me the
New Yorker’s address.”</p>

<p>“That is a good move,” Madame Yvonett nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>“I’ve also notified the Washington dealer, and he
has agreed to send a letter to other well-known
numismatists telling them of the coin, and asking
for the name of the person who offers it for sale.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>Fortunately the coin is very rare, and its appearance
will arouse interest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And cupidity,” chimed in Madame Yvonett.
“Collectors are said to be not too scrupulous; if
they can buy it cheaply from the thief they will not
be likely to notify thee, the real owner.”</p>

<p>“Of course, there’s that danger,” admitted Tom,
rising. “I’m afraid I must be going, Cousin
Yvonett; you’ve been awfully good to listen to me.”</p>

<p>“I am always interested in anything that concerns
thee, Thomas, and thy news today is startling.
Shall I mention the matter to Marjorie?”</p>

<p>Tom pondered for a moment before answering.
“I don’t believe I would; she is thrown a good deal
with the Calhoun-Coopers, and knowledge of Joe’s
dishonesty might embarrass her in her relations
with them.”</p>

<p>“Had thee not better question her about the disappearance
of the coin? She may be able to throw
some light on the mystery.”</p>

<p>Again Tom shook his head. “If any of the
others had seen Joe steal the coin, they would have
denounced him then and there, or dropped me a
hint later, and Marjorie particularly would have
been sure to have done so.”</p>

<p>“That is true, Marjorie has thy interests very
much to heart; she has not forgotten how good thee
has been to me financially.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever speak of that again,” protested
Tom warmly. “I’d do everything for you if I
could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Thee is like thy father in generosity,” Madame
Yvonett patted his shoulder lovingly. “Be cautious
in thy actions, Thomas; better lose a coin than
wrongfully accuse another. I advise thee to go
carefully over the floor of the dining-room and
parlor, the coin may have rolled and slipped into
a tiny crevice, or down the register.”</p>

<p>Tom frowned in disbelief. “There are no registers,
the house is heated by steam; however, I’ll
look again over the furniture and floors. I’m not
going to the dinner the Calhoun-Coopers are giving
next week. I can’t eat their food, believing Joe a
thief. Good-bye, I’ll be in again soon.”</p>

<p>After his departure Madame Yvonett remained
seated in the little parlor, her knitting in her lap
and her usually industrious fingers at rest, while
her thoughts centered themselves on Tom’s account
of the disappearance of his coin.</p>

<p>“I wish Marjorie had not been present,” she said
aloud.</p>

<p>“Did you call me?” inquired Miss Rebekah, as
she divested herself of her coat and gloves in the
hall. “All alone, Cousin Yvonett? Why, Marjorie
told me she was surely coming in to be with
you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marjorie had fully intended stopping in to see
her aunt that morning, but she had been delayed
in reaching Center Market, and afterwards, having
an errand to do on F Street, she had decided to
walk instead of taking a street car. Turning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>corner at Ninth and F Streets she came face to face
with Chichester Barnard.</p>

<p>“What good luck to meet you!” His tone of
pleasure was convincing in its heartiness, and Marjorie’s
eyes danced. “Which way are you going?”</p>

<p>“To Brentano’s.”</p>

<p>“I have an errand there, too,” falling into step
beside her. “I had a telephone a short time ago
from Miss Janet asking me to lunch with them.”</p>

<p>“She said she intended to invite you;” some of
the sparkle had disappeared from Marjorie’s eyes.
“Can you come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, fortunately this is not a very busy day
with me,” he raised his hat to Mrs. Walbridge
who passed them in her automobile. “Are you and
Miss Janet going to Mrs. Walbridge’s Christmas
Eve dance?”</p>

<p>“I think so; here we are,” and she led the way
inside the book-store. It did not take her long to
complete her errand, and she found Barnard waiting
for her at the entrance, a magazine tucked under
his arm.</p>

<p>“All ready?” he inquired, holding open the door
for her. “Are you going to do any more shopping?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then take a walk with me?” eagerly. “We
don’t have to be at the Fordyce’s until one o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I told Aunt Yvonett I would run in for a few
minutes on my way uptown....”</p>

<p>“You can go there after lunch,” broke in Barnard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
“Besides, there’s a business matter I must
talk over with you.”</p>

<p>A premonition of bad news sent a faint shiver
down Marjorie’s spine, and she glanced almost
pleadingly at her companion.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;&mdash;?” she began, then stopped. “Where
shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we walk around the White Lot,” he
suggested, after a moment’s thought. “We’re not
likely to be interrupted there,” turning to bow to
some friends.</p>

<p>“Very well,” agreed Marjorie briefly, quickening
her pace, and talking of indifferent subjects they
made their way up busy F Street, across Fifteenth,
back of the Treasury, and round to the Ellipse. Barnard
pointed to one of the empty benches which
stood on the outer edge of the huge circle of well-kept
turf, and Marjorie followed him to it.</p>

<p>“Well, what is your news?” she demanded, after
waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>“You are so literal, Madge,” he said, with
a half sigh. “Give a poor beggar a chance
to look at you; I’m reveling in having you to myself
again.”</p>

<p>But Marjorie drew away from him. “Your
news, please; I know it’s bad, or you would not
hesitate to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” Barnard thumped the
turf nervously with his cane. “Do you know your
aunt, Madame Yvonett, has a chattel mortgage
with the Wellington Loan Company?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; she took it out during mother’s last illness.
How did you come to hear of it, Chichester?”</p>

<p>“The Wellington Company has turned the mortgage
over to me to collect for them. I do their
legal work, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t aware of it.” Marjorie drew in
her breath sharply. “The interest is not due until
next week.”</p>

<p>“But, my dearest girl, they want more than their
interest&mdash;they require the principal.”</p>

<p>“The company agreed to permit Aunt Yvonett to
pay that off gradually.”</p>

<p>“Has your aunt a written agreement to that
effect?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know positively, but Mr. Saunders always
attends to that for her.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately Saunders is no longer president
of the company, and the new head is a very different
type of man. He insists on calling in all loans
which have run for a considerable period.”</p>

<p>“It’s hateful of him!” Marjorie stamped with
sudden fury. “Aunt Yvonett is trying so hard
to pay off her debts, and she took this mortgage
so that mother could have some comforts and
proper care before she died. Oh, I can’t let him
foreclose!”</p>

<p>Unconscious of Barnard’s intent gaze, she stared
at the distant White House, picturesque in its setting;
then with tired, restless eyes turned to look at
the still more distant Washington Monument, whose
tapering shaft seemed lost in fleecy clouds. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>knew that hundreds of migrating birds nightly beat
themselves to death against the towering marble
shaft, a shaft as immovable as that Fate which was
shaping her destiny.</p>

<p>“How much money does Aunt Yvonett owe the
company?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Barnard consulted his note book. “The total
sum is eleven hundred and forty-three dollars and
seventeen cents.”</p>

<p>Marjorie swallowed hard; the amount loomed
even larger than the Washington Monument. Her
first month’s salary at the Fordyces’ had gone to
meet current expenses, and to buy Madame Yvonett
a much needed gown. Where could she turn?</p>

<p>“I took over this business,” continued Barnard,
“because I feared another lawyer might give you
trouble. Why not let me advance you the money,
Madge?”</p>

<p>“No, never!” Barnard winced at the abrupt refusal,
and observing his hurt expression, she added
hastily, “Your offer was kindly meant, Chichester,
and I thank you; but accepting your assistance is
quite out of the question.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” quickly. “I worship the
ground you walk on&mdash;Madge, darling, why must
I give all, and you give nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing?” asked the girl drearily, and she
closed her eyes to keep back the blinding tears.
“Worship is not all a woman requires; there is honor
and faith....”</p>

<p>“You doubt my sincerity?” he demanded hotly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>
<p>“Can you blame me?” She shrugged her shoulders
disdainfully. “Have I not daily evidence of
your attentions to Janet Fordyce?”</p>

<p>Barnard threw back his head and laughed long
and heartily. “Madge, are you quite blind?” he
asked. “I am attentive to Janet, yes, because then
I can be near you. Do you really suppose I care
for that bread-and-butter miss?”</p>

<p>“Bread and butter’s very good for a steady diet,”
Marjorie passed a nervous hand over her forehead.
“Particularly when it’s spread with gold dust.”</p>

<p>“Steady, Madge, steady; there are some insults
a man can’t take from even a woman.” Barnard’s
eyes were flashing ominously, and every bit of color
had deserted his face. “Have you no spark of feeling
about you? Are you all adamantine? Have
you no recollection of the night we plighted our
troth?” his voice quivered with pent-up passion, and
she moved uneasily.</p>

<p>“I am not the one who forgot, Chichester,” she
said, refusing to meet his eyes. “When I found&mdash;changed
conditions, I gave you back your freedom.”</p>

<p>“Because I had not been to see you for a couple
of days. What a reason!” he laughed mirthlessly.
“You accuse me of lack of faith; come, where was
<i>your</i> faith?”</p>

<p>“It’s the pot calling the kettle black;” Marjorie,
intent on controlling her impulse to cry, failed to
observe Barnard’s altered demeanor. He had been
intently studying the varying emotions which flitted
across her face, and, keen student of human nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>that he was, instantly put his knowledge of her
character to the test.</p>

<p>“Come,” he sprang to his feet. “We will go to
Madame Yvonett....”</p>

<p>“What for?” in alarm, the recollection of the
chattel mortgage returning to her.</p>

<p>“To ask her consent to our marriage.”</p>

<p>Marjorie sat back in her seat. “Would you wed
me, the beggar maid?”</p>

<p>“Within the hour, if you wish.” He leaned nearer
her, and his hot passionate words soothed her
troubled heart, and finally dispelled her last lingering
doubt. She gazed at him half shyly, never had he
appeared to greater advantage, her chevalier “<i>sans
peur et sans reproche</i>.” A piercing automobile
siren brought her back from her day-dream.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” she asked in some alarm.</p>

<p>Barnard looked at his watch. “Twenty minutes
of one.”</p>

<p>“Then we can just do it,” and snatching up her
chain bag, she led the way to Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>“Are we going to Madame Yvonett’s?” he asked
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Not now.” Her eyes smiled wistfully back into
his.</p>

<p>“Madge, won’t you marry me?” stopping directly
in front of her.</p>

<p>“Not just yet.” Marjorie only saw the bitter disappointment
in the fine eyes regarding her so wistfully;
she never caught the significance of his
long-drawn sigh of relief. “I have some pride,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>Chichester. Let me first get clear of my debts, and
then we’ll talk of marriage.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you let me help you with that chattel
mortgage?” pleaded Barnard.</p>

<p>“No,” gently. “I shall write to some friends in
New York&mdash;here comes our car, Chichester, do
hurry.”</p>

<p>So intent were they on catching the car that neither
noticed a well-dressed young woman watching them
from a bench in Lafayette Square. Nurse Allen
grew white to the lips and her pretty eyes glittered
with a more powerful emotion than tears as she
observed Barnard’s tender solicitude for Marjorie
as he escorted her across the street.</p>

<p>“Still playing the old game,” she muttered, tossing
a handful of peanuts to three park squirrels, and
gathering up her bag and muff she turned her footsteps
toward Admiral Lawrence’s house.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the Fordyce residence Barnard
was ushered into the sunny library by the footman,
while Marjorie hastily sought her room. Barnard
found Janet and her brother waiting for him.</p>

<p>“I hope I’m not late,” he said, selecting a seat
near Janet, who resumed work on the necktie she
was crocheting.</p>

<p>“You are just on time,” remarked Duncan.
“Mother is the tardy member of the household&mdash;and
Miss Langdon.”</p>

<p>“Marjorie is usually prompt,” Janet gave a tug
at her spool of silk; the work-basket overturned, and
its contents scattered in all directions. “Oh, don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>trouble,” as the two men stooped to gather up the
different articles.</p>

<p>“What’s this, Janet?” asked Duncan, picking up
a heavy gold object which had rolled toward him.
Barnard’s eyes dilated, and he shot a swift look at
Janet.</p>

<p>“A ring,” she replied. “A gold signet ring.”</p>

<p>“So it seems.” Duncan examined it with care.
“A man’s ring?” raising gravely questioning eyes to
his sister’s.</p>

<p>“And made to fit a girl’s finger.” Janet took it
from him, and slipped it on, “but too large for me.”</p>

<p>“Take it off,” commanded Barnard in her ear as
the library door opened, but she shook her head
violently and turned to the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Look, Marjorie,” she called audaciously, displaying
the ring on her finger. “Treasure trove.”</p>

<p>Recognizing the familiar ring, Marjorie’s heart
lost a beat, then raced onward, as she said clearly:</p>

<p>“To have and to hold, Janet,” and Barnard’s eyes
shifted before the scorn in hers.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ONLY WOMAN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“A</span>lmost</span> the amount,” mused Marjorie folding
the letter and placing it carefully
away in the top drawer of her bureau.
“The company will have to take it and wait for
the remainder. I can do no more,” and she turned
dejectedly in her chair and surveyed her room, the
dainty furnishings of which left nothing to be desired
in point of taste and comfort. Mrs. Fordyce had
given Marjorie the large double room on the second
bedroom floor, and adjoining Janet’s, the two girls
using the communicating dressing-room.</p>

<p>The past few days had sorely taxed Marjorie’s
composure and endurance. Besides her worry over
money matters, her awakening to Chichester
Barnard’s duplicity had shocked her beyond measure.
The disillusion had been complete. Barnard was
but a common fortune hunter; Janet his quarry,
and her paid chaperon only a plaything to amuse
his idle hours. Marjorie burned with shame and
indignation at his daring to hold her so cheaply.
What had she done that he should have so poor
an opinion of her intelligence and integrity as to
believe she should tamely submit to being made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>cat’s-paw? The thought scorched her like a white-hot
iron. She saw Barnard with new eyes; he was
undeniably handsome, entirely selfish, plausible&mdash;ah,
too plausible; it had been his charm of manner and
fascinating personality which had held her captive
for so long, and quieted her haunting doubts of his
sincerity.</p>

<p>She felt it to be her duty to warn Mrs. Fordyce
of Barnard’s true character, but hesitated, fearing
her motive might be misconstrued. Janet would
undoubtedly declare her interference sprang from
jealousy. It was obvious that the young girl was
flattered by Barnard’s attention, and Marjorie reasoned
that opposition would but fan her liking into
an impetuous espousing of his cause, and that might
lead to the very thing Marjorie most heartily wished
avoided. During wakeful nights she decided to temporize;
to quietly undermine whatever influence
Barnard had gained over Janet’s impressionable
nature, and to see that his friendly footing in the
household was discontinued. But it was uphill work,
for Barnard had ingratiated himself with every
member of the family, except Duncan, and Marjorie
had sought her room after luncheon thoroughly
discouraged. A tap at the door disturbed her, and
on opening it, she found Mrs. Fordyce’s maid standing
in the hall.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fordyce would like to have you stop in her
boudoir, Miss Marjorie, before you go out,” she
said respectfully.</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Fordyce I will come at once, Blanche,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>and pausing long enough to get her coat and furs,
she ran down to the first bedroom floor and entered
the boudoir. With a word of apology, she passed
Calderon Fordyce, and sat down on the lounge by
his wife.</p>

<p>“Father’s on the rampage,” announced Janet, uncurling
herself in the depths of a large chair. “He
pretends to be awfully shocked at the Calhoun-Cooper
dinner last night.”</p>

<p>“There’s no pretense about it,” fumed Fordyce.
“Why I was invited is beyond me....”</p>

<p>“I suppose they thought they couldn’t ask me
without you,” broke in Janet. “Duncan hasn’t been
decently civil to Joe, and Marjorie wasn’t invited
either.”</p>

<p>“If you had followed Marjorie’s advice you would
not have accepted the invitation, Calderon,” said
Mrs. Fordyce mildly. “Were the Coopers so very
<i>outré</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Coopers themselves weren’t bad,” admitted
Fordyce.</p>

<p>“You seemed to get on beautifully with Pauline
during dinner,” protested Janet.</p>

<p>“How was she dressed?” asked Mrs. Fordyce,
whose busy mind was taken up with replenishing
Janet’s wardrobe.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I didn’t glance under the table,”
growled Fordyce.</p>

<p>“I hear Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper and Pauline are
called ‘High-Lo,’” added Janet, winking mischievously
at Marjorie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“And who is ‘Jack in the game’?” demanded
Fordyce.</p>

<p>“Her latest admirer,” retorted his daughter, flippantly.</p>

<p>“What roused your ire at the dinner?” demanded
Mrs. Fordyce, bestowing a frown on Janet.</p>

<p>“Janet’s contemporaries made up the guests,
Judge and Mrs. Walbridge and I being thrown in for
good measure,” smiled Fordyce. “Left more or
less to myself I watched the arrival of the young
people, and I give you my word, Flora, the main
endeavor of each guest appeared to be how to enter
the drawing-room without greeting their host and
hostess&mdash;and most of them succeeded in their purpose.
I have seen better manners in a lumber
camp.”</p>

<p>“What would the older generation do if they
didn’t have us to criticize?” asked Janet, raising her
hands in mock horror.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you, young lady, if I catch you forgetting
the manners your mother taught you, I’ll
pack you off to a convent,” warned Fordyce.</p>

<p>“You needn’t get so awfully excited,” objected
his daughter, looking a trifle subdued. “I’m sure
some of the married people are just as rude.”</p>

<p>“The more shame to them; they are old enough
to know better,” declared Fordyce. “Life is too
short to bother with ill-bred and stupid people. I
came to Washington to avoid them.”</p>

<p>“Pray, who sent you here?” inquired Marjorie.</p>

<p>“I thought a friend,” Fordyce’s eyes twinkled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>“Now I’ve mingled in Capital society, I’m beginning
to believe that my friend had a perverted sense of
humor.”</p>

<p>“You are too harsh in your judgment, Calderon,”
put in Mrs. Fordyce. “Rudeness we have with us
everywhere, whereas in Washington, while there are
numerous <i>nouveaux riches</i> seeking social recognition,
who think lack of manners shows <i>savoir faire</i>, there
are also many distinguished men and women spending
the winter here. In addition the resident circle
is certainly most charming and cultivated. The
people who strive for vulgar ostentatious display
are grafted from other cities.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to be put in that class,” remarked
Fordyce. “So, Janet, mind your p’s
and q’s.”</p>

<p>Janet rose abruptly. “’Nuff said, Daddy. Are
you going downtown, Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Did you wish to see me, Mrs. Fordyce?”</p>

<p>“I will be greatly obliged if you will stop at
Galt’s, Marjorie, and order the articles I had put
aside yesterday, sent to me; then please stop at
Small’s....”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go with you,” volunteered Janet.</p>

<p>“Hurry then,” Fordyce darted an impatient look
at the mantel clock. “Two thirty-five. I’ll send
you both down in the motor, and you can stop
at the bank, Janet, and draw a check for me.
I’ll go and make it out; come to the library
before you go,” and he left the room, followed by
Janet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>
<p>“Are you happy here, Marjorie?” asked Mrs.
Fordyce, turning directly to the girl.</p>

<p>“What a question, dear Mrs. Fordyce! You have
done everything for my comfort,” and Marjorie
looked gratefully at the older woman. “I have seldom
met with such consideration and kindness. You&mdash;you
are not dissatisfied with me?” in quick alarm.</p>

<p>“No, indeed.” Mrs. Fordyce’s tone was flattering
in its sincerity, and Marjorie’s fears were allayed.
“I can’t get on without you; in fact, I am
afraid I’m putting too much upon you. You are so
dependable I forget your youth.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s laugh was followed by an unconscious
sigh. “Youth with me is a thing of the past; I rival
Methuselah,” she said lightly. “Don’t worry about
me, dear Mrs. Fordyce; I can never do enough to
repay your kindness. My work here is most congenial.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Marjorie,” called Janet from the
hall.</p>

<p>“Go, my dear,” Mrs. Fordyce impulsively kissed
Marjorie. “Don’t keep my husband waiting; he’ll
never forgive you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fordyce had been by herself but a scant ten
minutes when the hall door again opened and Duncan
walked in.</p>

<p>“Where’s everybody?” he demanded, seating himself
by her.</p>

<p>“Your father had an engagement at the Riding
and Hunt Club.” She inspected the clock. “He
should be there now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“And what are the others doing?”</p>

<p>“Janet and Marjorie? Oh, they are out shopping
for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d known it, I’d have gone with them,”
and he beat an impatient tattoo on the back of the
lounge.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you find Washington very dull,” said
Mrs. Fordyce regretfully. “But I am selfish enough
to wish to keep you here. Stay as long as you can,
dear.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m going to stay,” heartily, catching
the wistful appeal in her eyes. “I’ve given up returning
to the West until February and you’ll have
me on your hands until then.”</p>

<p>“That’s dear of you, Duncan,” she leaned over
and stroked his hand. “My bonnie big boy,” and
there was infinite pride in her tone. “You have no
idea of my joy in having your father, Janet, and you
under one roof again. This will be a blessed Christmas
to me.”</p>

<p>She sat silent as memories of lonely years in their
San Francisco home rose before her. Originally
from Boston, she had married Calderon Fordyce in
New York, and had accompanied him to the Pacific
coast where he had eventually built up an immense
importing trade. His business had taken him
frequently to the Orient, and Mrs. Fordyce after her
railroad accident had perforce remained in San Francisco.
She had not minded her husband’s absences
so much while her children were young, but when
Duncan departed to college, and later Janet to boarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
school, her loneliness and physical condition had
preyed so much on her mind that her husband had
become alarmed. On consulting their physician,
Calderon Fordyce had been advised to see that his
wife had more distractions, and placing his business
affairs in competent hands, he and Mrs. Fordyce
had spent the past few years traveling in Europe,
and while there she had formed the plan to introduce
Janet to Washington society on her reaching
her eighteenth year.</p>

<p>“I am particularly glad for Janet’s sake that you
are here, Duncan,” she said presently. “It is nice
for her to have a big elder brother at dances and
dinners.”</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon takes such excellent care of Janet
that my services as cavalier are not required,” replied
Duncan lazily. “Janet is pretty enough to have
plenty of partners, and Miss Langdon sees that she
meets men.”</p>

<p>“I think I was very lucky to secure Marjorie,”
and Mrs. Fordyce nodded her head complacently.</p>

<p>“I think you were,” agreed Duncan, idly turning
the leaves of a magazine. “I’m afraid Janet is
tiring her out.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Too many late parties,” tersely. “Miss Langdon
is fagged out.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look strong,” admitted Mrs. Fordyce
thoughtfully. “But I think her pale cheeks and
distrait manner are induced by a love affair.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” Duncan turned toward his mother with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>unusual sharpness. “Who’s the man?” The question
seemed almost forced from him.</p>

<p>“Chichester Barnard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense.”</p>

<p>“It is not nonsense,” replied Mrs. Fordyce, somewhat
nettled by his manner. “I have watched them
very closely when they are together, and I am sure
I am right.” Duncan rose abruptly and walked over
to the window. “Mr. Barnard and Marjorie are
both so good looking that they would make an ideal
couple.”</p>

<p>“Ideal?” Duncan’s laugh was mirthless. “You
are an idealist, mother.”</p>

<p>“Better that than an image breaker,” retorted
Mrs. Fordyce. “Now, run along, dear, I must take
my usual afternoon nap.”</p>

<p>“All right, mother, I’ll be down in the billiard-room
if you should want me.”</p>

<p>Duncan spent an unsatisfactory hour knocking
the balls around, then took refuge in the library.
Selecting a novel he made himself comfortable before
the open fire, and commenced reading. But his
attention wandered from the printed page; before
him constantly was Marjorie Langdon’s face. Surely
he had not found his ideal but to lose her? He
caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror over the
fireplace, and his mouth set grimly. What chance
had his plain features and taciturn manner against
Barnard’s handsome face and gay debonair personality?
He had inherited his looks and his temperament
from some dour Scotch ancestor. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>would take a miracle to make him a parlor knight.
His book fell with a thud to the floor, and as he
stooped to pick it up, the door opened and Marjorie
walked in.</p>

<p>“Can I see your father?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, he is not in,” Duncan sprang up and
pushed forward a chair. “Won’t I serve the purpose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” She stepped forward and removed a
small roll of bank notes from her muff. “Janet
cashed one hundred and fifty dollars for your father,
and asked me to give it to him. Will you see that
the money reaches him?” placing the bank notes on
the library table. “I’m afraid I can’t sit down, Mr.
Fordyce; your sister is waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“Let her wait,” calmly. “It’s beastly cold outside;
I am sure the fire will be a comfort. Sit down
for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t,” Marjorie’s color, made brilliant by
the wind outside, deepened to a warmer tint as she
caught his eyes. “Janet and Baron von Valkenberg
are waiting in the motor for me; we are going down
to the Basin to skate. The river is frozen over,
you know. Good-bye,” and she vanished through
the doorway.</p>

<p>“D&mdash;mn! they might have asked me to go along!”
Duncan threw a fresh log on the fire as a slight vent
to his feelings, then strolled over to the window
opening on Sheridan Circle. He was just in time to
see Marjorie assisted into the waiting motor by
Chichester Barnard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Duncan drew back, stung to the quick, and making
his way to the table, dropped into his father’s revolving
chair. For a time he sat blindly scratching
marks on a pad, then threw down his pencil in disgust.</p>

<p>“The only woman!” he muttered, and his clenched
hands parted slowly. As he rose to leave the room
his eyes fell on a small pile of bank notes lying on
the floor where he had knocked them some minutes
before. He gathered them up, and paused idly to
count the bills.... “Nine tens, ten tens, one
hundred; one ten&mdash;&mdash;” his hand remained suspended
in the air; surely Marjorie had mentioned
one hundred and fifty dollars? Where was the odd
forty? He went slowly over the bills again, with
the same result&mdash;one hundred and ten dollars.</p>

<p>With infinite pains Duncan searched the table and
then the floor. Leaving the library he went carefully
down the hall and staircase, and from there to the
front door and down to the street. Finding no
trace of any bank notes, he retraced his steps to the
house, but instead of mounting the stairs he went
up in the lift, first carefully examining its interior.
On reaching the drawing-room floor he returned to
the library and sat for some time contemplating the
fire. The tinkle of the telephone bell aroused him,
and he hastened to remove the receiver.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is Duncan Fordyce,” he called. “Yes,
Janet, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t rent a pair of skates here that will fit
me,” came Janet’s answer. “Please have Blanche
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>hunt in my closet and find my own pair, and send
them down to me by messenger at once, Duncan.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to it,” he promised. “Wait, Janet.
Did you draw out some money for father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a hundred and fifty dollars. Marjorie said
she gave it to you. What did you say, Duncan?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ll send the skates. Good-bye,” and
he banged up the receiver. But it was some minutes
before he moved, and when he rose there were lines
about his mouth which had not been there before.
He pushed the electric bell, and on Perkins’ entrance,
gave him full instructions regarding the
skates. As the butler left the room, Calderon
Fordyce appeared.</p>

<p>“All alone, Duncan?” he asked. “Where’s
Janet?”</p>

<p>“Down skating on the Potomac.”</p>

<p>“Deuce take the girl! What does she mean by
gadding about? I told her to return here at once
with my money. I promised to advance Perkins’
wages, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Janet left it with me,” Duncan stepped forward
and handed his father the roll of bills. “Here it is.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Duncan,” Fordyce took out his leather
wallet and stuffed the bank notes inside it.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cautioned Duncan. “Hadn’t you better
count your money?”</p>

<p>Fordyce eyed his son in astonishment. “What
are you driving at?” he demanded brusquely. “I’m
not in the habit of questioning anything you and
Janet give me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Some of that money is missing,” stated Duncan.</p>

<p>“What?” Fordyce’s smile vanished, and his eyes
darkened.</p>

<p>“I borrowed forty dollars,” added Duncan tranquilly.
“Here’s my check for the amount,” taking
it up from the table. “I needed the ready money,
so”&mdash;smiling whimsically, “helped myself.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Calhoun-Cooper</span> contemplated
her daughter with distinct admiration,
albeit mixed with some alarm.</p>

<p>“My dear Pauline,” she said, lowering her
lorgnette. “I have seldom seen you look so well,
but&mdash;eh&mdash;don’t you think your gown is a trifle too&mdash;too
pronounced?”</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t.” Pauline revolved slowly, the
better to show the expensive Paquin model which
she was wearing. “Nothing is extreme these days;
I mean everything is extreme.”</p>

<p>“Hello, why the beauty show?” demanded Joe
from the doorway of the library.</p>

<p>“Joseph! You are not in evening clothes!”
wailed his mother. “And Pauline is waiting for you
to take her to the Walbridge dance.”</p>

<p>“I forgot the beastly thing,” grumbled Joe, sauntering
over to a chair. “I’ve been so busy today.”</p>

<p>“Same old business, Joe?” questioned Pauline
significantly, scanning his rumpled appearance with
no kindly eye. “Really, father will be deeply interested
to hear you are so engrossed in the pursuit
of pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“Cut it out,” admonished her brother roughly.
“I’ve stood all I’m going to from you.”</p>

<p>“Stop this bickering, instantly,” commanded Mrs.
Calhoun-Cooper. “And you, Joseph, go upstairs at
once and change your clothes. If you don’t,” meeting
the mutinous glare with which he favored her,
“I shall telephone at once to the Capitol and report
your conduct to your father. You know what <i>that</i>
means,” with marked emphasis.</p>

<p>Joe knew only too well. Spoiled and indulged
by a silly mother, bullied by Pauline, the only person
he held in wholesome awe was his father. Some of
his indiscretions had been exploited in the newspapers,
and before coming to Washington, his father
had lain down a cast-iron rule for him to follow in
the future. Joe moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>“There’s no occasion for you and Pauline to get
excited,” he protested. “It won’t take me ten minutes
to shift into my dress suit.”</p>

<p>“Take time enough to make yourself presentable,”
cautioned Pauline. “I’m particular as to the appearance
of my escorts.”</p>

<p>“One wouldn’t guess it, judging from the men you
have hanging around,” sneered Joe, wrath overcoming
discretion.</p>

<p>“That will do,” Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper stamped
her foot. “Joseph, go at once to your room; the car
is already waiting for you and Pauline.”</p>

<p>Muttering uncomplimentary remarks under his
breath, Joe started for the door. Passing his
father’s desk his eyes fell on a pile of apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>unopened letters awaiting Representative Calhoun-Cooper’s
return from the Capitol where he had been
detained since noon. Recognizing the handwriting
on the topmost envelope, Joe’s flushed face paled,
and a slight shiver ran down his back. Pauline,
intent on arranging a corsage bouquet, paid no
further attention to her brother, and Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
was equally absorbed in watching her. Joe
paused a moment in indecision; then leaned over and
palmed the letter with neatness and dispatch.</p>

<p>Judge and Mrs. Erastus Walbridge’s handsome
residence was <i>en fête</i> when Pauline and Joe finally
put in an appearance. The spacious rooms and hallways,
festooned with Southern smilax in which were
twined tiny iridescent electric lights, and hung with
holly, mistletoe, and poinsettia, resembled fairyland.
Mrs. Walbridge’s Christmas Eve dances had become
a time-honored institution, and invitations to them
were eagerly sought. She insisted that her guests
should arrive at half-past nine and depart at two
o’clock; such early dancing hours being kept at no
other house in the National Capital. As she always
provided the best of music and the most delicious
of suppers, society invariably abided by her rulings,
although sometimes enjoying a hearty laugh behind
her back.</p>

<p>Pauline did not linger in the dressing-room. Taking
her cloak check, she hastened into the ballroom
followed by Joe, who presented a remarkably immaculate
appearance considering the short time consumed
in changing his clothes. Mrs. Walbridge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>conscious that the hour was getting late, received
them with some stiffness, but Pauline’s profuse
apologies for their tardy arrival caused her to unbend.</p>

<p>“I think you already know Baron von Valkenberg,”
she said, as the diplomat joined them, and in
a second more Pauline was dancing with him.</p>

<p>Joe, left to himself, for Mrs. Walbridge’s attention
was instantly claimed by an older guest, saw
Marjorie Langdon standing talking to several
friends and crossed the room to speak to her. He
did not share his family’s antipathy for Marjorie.
It took him several moments to dodge the dancers
as he progressed across the floor, and just as he
reached Marjorie’s side Chichester Barnard came
up.</p>

<p>“No you don’t, Barnard,” he exclaimed. “First
come, first served. My dance, Miss Langdon?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I have a prior claim,” protested
Barnard.</p>

<p>“Quite wrong,” smiled Marjorie. “I am promised
to nobody for this dance.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m Johnny on the spot,” chimed in
Joe, triumphantly. “Come,” and placing his arm
about Marjorie’s waist, the two danced down the
room.</p>

<p>Refusing to meet the eyes of several wallflowers
who were looking hopefully in his direction, Barnard
idly watched the gay throng, as the waxed floor
swayed under the tread of flying feet.</p>

<p>“The popular Mr. Barnard not dancing!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
a voice over his shoulder, and turning he
found Pauline standing at his elbow.</p>

<p>“I was looking for you,” he answered readily,
“but I thought I saw you with von Valkenberg....”</p>

<p>“He was sent for to go to the telephone,” she
pouted prettily, “and had to excuse himself.”</p>

<p>“Let me take his place,” and clasping her hand
they joined the dancers. When the music stopped
Barnard secured a glass of punch for his partner and
himself, and they strolled about, at last going into
what Mrs. Walbridge called her “tea-room.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that Joe and Miss Langdon sitting over
there?” questioned Pauline, indicating a deep window
recess partly screened from the general view by
tall palms.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we join them,” paying no attention to
the shortness of his tone. “Joe is so susceptible to
pretty women, and Miss Langdon is more than
pretty. How does she get on with Mrs. Fordyce?”</p>

<p>“Very well, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Then she must have a remarkable disposition,
for I am told that Mrs. Fordyce’s peculiarities make
her difficult to live with,” responded Pauline. “A
friend of mother’s acted as her companion in San
Francisco while Janet was at boarding-school, and
she said Mrs. Fordyce’s curious....” she broke
off abruptly. “Good evening, Miss Langdon,”
sweetly. “I am afraid I shall have to carry off my
brother,” slipping her arm inside his as he rose at
her approach. Joe’s face darkened, and he raged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>inwardly. It was like Pauline to spoil his fun and
make him appear ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Be satisfied with Mr. Barnard, sister mine,” he
said coolly. “I am having a very good time where I
am.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of that,” Pauline’s voice was
venomous under its honey sweetness. “But do think
of poor Miss Langdon! There are two débutantes
anxious to meet you, dear, so come; Miss Langdon
will excuse us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” Marjorie allowed a faint hint
of her secret amusement to creep into her charmingly
modulated voice. “I quite understand. Shall I keep
a dance for you later, Mr. Cooper?” purposely omitting
the “Calhoun.”</p>

<p>“Well, rather; two at the very least,” pleaded Joe.
“Do, Miss Langdon, I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>“Coming, Mr. Barnard?” inquired Pauline, then
bit her lip as he shook his head.</p>

<p>“I have the next dance with Miss Langdon, so of
course&mdash;&mdash;” a courteous bow completed his sentence,
and Pauline turned abruptly on her heel and left
them.</p>

<p>“A curious pair,” commented Barnard. “Cooper
appears completely under his sister’s thumb.”</p>

<p>“She has the stronger personality.”</p>

<p>“You put it politely,” laughed Barnard. “Miss
Calhoun-Cooper is a handsome vixen.”</p>

<p>“A type you do not admire.”</p>

<p>“I admire no type,” smoothly. “Only one girl.”</p>

<p>“Janet will be complimented.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“I was not referring to Miss Janet....”</p>

<p>“Actions speak louder than words.”</p>

<p>“Not when the wrong construction is put on
them.”</p>

<p>“Must we go over that again?” asked Marjorie
wearily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” vehemently. “On my word of honor I
never gave that ring to Janet.”</p>

<p>“What a liar you are, Chichester.”</p>

<p>Barnard’s hand closed over her wrist in a grip
that made her wince. “By heaven! you must take
that back.”</p>

<p>For reply she shrugged her shoulders disdainfully.
Her open scorn stung him. Freeing her wrist, he
fumbled in his vest pocket, then drew out his signet
ring and held it before her.</p>

<p>“Are you convinced, O Doubter?” he asked.</p>

<p>Marjorie shot a swift look at him, and then at
the gold circlet in his hand. “How did you get it
back?”</p>

<p>“By asking for it.”</p>

<p>“On what grounds?”</p>

<p>“That I lost the ring the night of their first dinner-dance.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s scornful regard swept him from head
to foot.</p>

<p>“Too flimsy,” she commented. “I have been
fooled by you once too often.”</p>

<p>Between rage and passion Barnard’s habitual self-control
forsook him. Catching her hand he forcibly
closed her fingers over the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“It’s yours, yours&mdash;do you hear!”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she retreated several steps from him,
and he followed her, his face alight with passion.</p>

<p>“My own darling!”</p>

<p>But she struck down his encircling arm, and fled
back into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Pausing to regain her usual tranquil bearing, she
discovered she had stopped beside Duncan Fordyce,
and she drew back. During the past week an indefinable
something in Duncan’s manner, an aloofness,
and a lack of the gentle deference he had first
accorded her, had been noticeable. From seeing
him frequently, she hardly saw him at all. She partly
turned and studied him attentively. The dimple,
almost a deft, relieved his stubborn chin of some of
its aggressiveness, and while he could never be called
handsome, he carried the “hall mark,” and his fine
figure never showed to better advantage than in a
dress suit, the crucial test offered to mankind by
modern customs tailors. Involuntarily she contrasted
him with Barnard, and admitted in her own
mind, that the latter, as ingratiating and handsome
as he was, suffered by the comparison. Her woman’s
intuition warned her that Duncan was a man to be
trusted, while Barnard....</p>

<p>Tired of watching the dancers, Duncan swung
around to leave the ballroom and almost collided
with her.</p>

<p>“You here!” he exclaimed. “And I didn’t know
it.” He pulled himself up, and his manner changed.
“You must think me very rude, Miss Marjorie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, only absorbed,” lightly, scanning the
scene before her. “There’s Janet dancing with Tom
Nichols.”</p>

<p>“As per usual,” Duncan laughed outright. “Where
are your eyes, Miss Chaperon?”</p>

<p>Marjorie reddened. “Upon my word, I look on
Tom as a brother&mdash;I never thought....” her
voice trailed off, and Duncan waited in vain for her
to finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“Nichols is a good fellow,” he said finally. “I
like him. Shall we dance?”</p>

<p>The invitation was given in so perfunctory a tone
that Marjorie’s ears tingled. She checked the curt
refusal on her lips, and instead accepted with a nonchalance
which matched his own. He should pay
for his indifference, pay dearly, she vowed to herself,
and her alluring smile stirred his pulses. Like
many big men he was extremely light on his feet, and
Marjorie circled the room with him in complete enjoyment
of the dance. Suddenly her strength deserted
her, and she stumbled and leaned heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>“The heat,” she murmured, as alarmed he bent
toward her. “I will be better in the hall.”</p>

<p>Shielding her from the other dancers, he helped
her from the room. The cooler atmosphere outside
revived her somewhat, and she was mumbling
some words of apology into Duncan’s anxious ear
when Mrs. Walbridge hove in sight. Seeing the
pair sitting on the stairs, she moved toward them as
rapidly as her avoirdupois permitted. Quickly Duncan
explained the situation to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“You poor child,” she said. “Go right upstairs
to my bedroom and lie down. You will find a pitcher
of ice water up there, or do you prefer a glass of
champagne?” Marjorie replied in the negative.
“Then go right up, my dear; I’ll be along presently,”
and she moved toward the ballroom.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to go with you?” inquired
Duncan anxiously. “Or shall I ring for a servant?”</p>

<p>“Neither, please. I know the house well, and I’ll
be all right after a short rest. You’ve been very
kind,” holding out her hand impulsively. He held
it tightly in both his own for a second, then silently
left her. She watched his tall form out of sight, and
sighing started slowly upstairs.</p>

<p>“Well, Duncan, where have you been hiding?”
asked Janet, meeting him on his return to the ballroom.</p>

<p>“Smoking,” laconically. “Do you want to dance?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” with uncompromising honesty.
“You haven’t been near me this evening.”</p>

<p>“I saw you were plentifully supplied with partners,”
Duncan suited his step to Janet’s. “Having
a good time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lovely,” and Janet’s animated face attested
the fact. “Where’s Marjorie?” They had reached
the end of the room, and as they made the turn, a
man left the group of stags and placed a detaining
hand on Duncan’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Brother and sister dancing together,” laughed
Barnard. “This will never do. Split this number
with me, Miss Janet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I will,” Janet hesitated. “It will serve
you right, Duncan; you’ve neglected me shamefully....”
waving a gay farewell she and Barnard disappeared
in the crowd of dancers. Duncan, making
his way to the smoking-room, encountered Pauline,
and paused to talk with her.</p>

<p>Barnard, conversing as he danced, finally observed
Pauline and Duncan sitting together. “Your
brother had better resign himself to the inevitable;
Miss Calhoun-Cooper has her talons on him,” he
laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t know Duncan,” retorted Janet. “He
has a will of his own.....” An awkward couple
cannonaded heavily against her.... “Ouch!”</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” questioned Barnard in alarm, as
Janet came to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>“I think that man has lamed me for life,” she
groaned. “His heel came down on my instep.”</p>

<p>“The cow; he needs a ten-acre lot to dance in!”
Barnard scowled at the receding couple. “Hadn’t
you better sit down, Janet?”</p>

<p>“Where?” and she glanced despairingly about.</p>

<p>“Come this way,” pointing to the tea-room, and
Janet limped after him to the window recess behind
the palms, and settled herself comfortably on the
wide cushioned window-seat. “You must be very
tired, my dearest,” glancing solicitously at her. “The
penalty for being the belle of the ball.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t thrust honors upon me,” she
laughed.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing too good for you,” he whispered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
“No wonder men adore you; you little darling”&mdash;she
moved uneasily as his arm slipped around
her waist. “Why won’t you let me speak to your
father?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she stammered. “A little more time,
Chichester&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barnard did not conceal his chagrin and disappointment.
“So that you may receive attentions
from other men?” he asked, his jealousy instantly
aflame.</p>

<p>“You wrong me,” Janet drew herself away with
gentle dignity. “You, least of all, have no cause for
jealousy. Only, Chichester, I must know my own
mind before our engagement is announced.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way; I am wax in your hands,”
he said fondly.</p>

<p>“Hark! there goes the music,” Janet studied her
dance card. “It must be an extra.”</p>

<p>“Good, we’ll sit it out together,” and he took her
hand.</p>

<p>“To think tomorrow is Christmas,” said Janet
dreamily, a few minutes later. “Or is it midnight
now?” Barnard pulled out his watch, and her attention
was focused on the handsome seal that hung
from the gold fob. “Let me see it, Chichester?”</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear her request. “Only
eleven!” he exclaimed. “It must be later. I believe
my watch has stopped. Can you hear any ticking?”
raising it to her ear.</p>

<p class="caption">“She was about to call her by name, when Janet quietly took
up a diamond sunburst.”</p>

<p>Upstairs in Mrs. Walbridge’s sumptuously furnished
bedroom Marjorie rested on the lounge in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>alcove. Only one electric light over the dressing-table
was turned on, and the semi-darkness of the
large room proved a welcome refuge from the glare
and heat downstairs, and the deadly faintness which
had almost overcome Marjorie, gradually disappeared.
An occasional shiver shook her, and she
groped about and pulled up the eiderdown quilt which
lay folded at the foot of the lounge. Through the
half-shut door strains of music came faintly, preventing
her from dozing off, and she turned restlessly
on her pillow. Suddenly conscious that her left hand
was tightly clenched, she loosened her cramped fingers,
and discovered that she still held Barnard’s
signet ring concealed in her rumpled handkerchief.</p>

<p>At that moment the hall door was pushed gently
open, and a young girl came into the room. Without
glancing into the shadows about her, she moved
directly to the dressing-table and stood arranging her
hair. As she halted under the full rays of the light,
Marjorie recognized Janet. She was about to call
her by name, when Janet quietly took up a diamond
sunburst from the jewel-box on the dressing-table,
and deliberately pinned it under the folds of lace on
her bodice, then glided from the room as noiselessly
as she had entered.</p>

<p>Petrified with astonishment Marjorie, hardly able
to believe the evidence of her senses, remained on
the lounge for one long minute; then collecting her
wits, she flung the eiderdown quilt to the floor, slipped
Barnard’s ring inside her bodice, and stole from the
room. She found Janet standing on the outskirts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>the large circle of guests surrounding a Santa Claus,
who was distributing gifts from his sack and a beautifully
decorated tree which had been carried into the
center of the ballroom.</p>

<p>“See, Marjorie,” exclaimed Janet, turning at her
touch. “Doesn’t the little man make an adorable
Santa?”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Marjorie wedged herself a little
closer to Janet’s side.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; some professional probably.
What’s he giving to Captain Nichols?” peering intently
down the room.</p>

<p>Quickly Marjorie seized her opportunity. Her
fingers deftly felt among the laces on Janet’s gown,
unfastened the sunburst, and, concealing the diamond
pin in her handkerchief, she fled swiftly upstairs
again. On turning the knob of Mrs. Walbridge’s
bedroom door she found it locked, and startled,
leaned trembling against the panels. How was she
to replace the sunburst in the jewel-box if she could
not gain admission to the room?</p>

<p>“My pin, please,” said a cold voice from behind
her, and wheeling, she confronted Mrs. Walbridge.
Mechanically Marjorie displayed the sunburst.</p>

<p>“How&mdash;&mdash;?” her voice died in her throat.</p>

<p>“I came up to inquire how you were; found my
jewel-box standing open, the sunburst missing, you
gone&mdash;&mdash;” Mrs. Walbridge shrugged her ponderous
shoulders. “I locked my door to prevent a recurrence
of&mdash;&mdash;” she broke off on meeting Marjorie’s
uncomprehending stare, and her harsh voice softened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
“My affection for your aunt, Madame
Yvonett, seals my lips, but I shall not receive you
again&mdash;good-night.”</p>

<p>Taking the sunburst from Marjorie’s nerveless
hand, she secured it in her gown and returned to her
guests, while slowly her meaning thrust itself on the
bewildered, frightened girl. Marjorie watched Mrs.
Walbridge in dumb agony; then made a hasty step
forward as the older woman reached the head of the
staircase. But a thought stayed her: if she told the
truth she would expose Janet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walbridge had disappeared inside the ballroom
when Marjorie, clinging tightly to the bannisters
for support, made her slow way down the
staircase. She paused an instant on the bottom
landing. From the ballroom came a burst of laughter
and round after round of applause, and Santa Claus,
his empty sack slung across his shoulders, and his
cheeks redder than ever, bounded into the square
hall. Before dashing out of the front door, which
a footman held open, he turned on his gay pursuers,
and raising his voice above the clamor, called:</p>

<p>“‘A Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!’”</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE COLD, GRAY DAWN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hichester Barnard</span> slipped off his
evening coat and put on his smoking-jacket,
and pausing in front of his chiffonier,
gazed hungrily at a photograph of Marjorie Langdon
leaning against his shaving-glass. The edges
were cut evenly, and to the most casual eye it was
obvious that the picture had been taken from a large
silver frame from whose center smiled a speaking
likeness of Janet Fordyce. Barnard picked up Marjorie’s
photograph and studied it long and intently,
and gradually the features assumed a life-like outline
and the eyes a natural fire, so completely did her
personality vitalize the inanimate photograph under
his rapt attention. With a shudder he dropped it
face downward.</p>

<p>“Ah! Madge, my darling,” he murmured sadly.
“Janet may occupy the silver frame, but not my
heart. I am tempted, sorely tempted, but dollars and
sense go together.”</p>

<p>Catching up a box of cigarettes, he switched off
the electric light, and entering his sitting-room, made
his way to the fireplace where fresh logs were burning
merrily on the hearth. He pulled up a Morris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>chair and warmed his hands at the blaze; then settled
back and stared at his surroundings.</p>

<p>Barnard had inherited the Georgetown property
on the death of his aunts, and, not having the means
to keep up the fine old mansion, and finding it impossible
to rent as a residence, he had had the
building remodeled and made into an apartment
house. He kept one of the bachelor apartments,
comprising sitting-room, bedroom, and bath, for his
own use. The two rooms were large and airy, and
the handsome antique furniture, also an inheritance
with the house, did not look amiss in their familiar
setting.</p>

<p>Chichester Barnard was the last of a long line of
distinguished ancestors, and from his earliest youth
pride of family had been drilled into him, and the
often repeated refrain, “A Barnard can do no
wrong,” became a fetish with him. He was as familiar
with family tradition as he was ignorant of true
democracy, but soon after attaining his majority he
was forced to realize that past glory did not pay
grocers’ bills, and that his blue blood was not a
useful commodity except in drawing-rooms. The
pricking of his inflated family pride brought in its
train a false value of money. With money what
could he not accomplish? What not buy? And the
acquisition of money became his lode-star.</p>

<p>By arduous work and much self-denial Barnard
was winning a deserved reputation in his profession,
but his impetuous temperament chafed at the slowness
with which he accumulated money. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>constantly seeking unscrupulous get-rich-quick
schemes and other short cuts to wealth, but with
heart-breaking regularity they came to nothing. He
had met Marjorie Langdon two years before and
had fallen madly in love with her, had persuaded
her to engage herself to him, and with a caution
which he inwardly despised, had made her promise
not to tell Madame Yvonett of their mutual attachment.
He felt that if the engagement was once
announced he would be irrevocably bound to marry
her; he longed to marry her, but&mdash;he would not
wed her while he was a poor man. He despised
poverty as before he had despised low birth.</p>

<p>Exaggerated reports of Janet Fordyce’s reputed
wealth, which she was to inherit on coming of age,
reached Barnard and aroused his cupidity. In the
past his affection for Marjorie had barred that all
too frequently traveled road to “Easy Street,” a
marriage for money; but he met Janet at a time when
his finances were low, and the idea was not so distasteful
as formerly; particularly when the girl, beside
her wealth, had charm, youth, and a lovable
disposition. But Barnard, like many another man,
was tempted to play with fire. The more inevitable
appeared his break with Marjorie, the more passionately
he loved her, and only the lure of wealth
kept him steadfast in his purpose.</p>

<p>Barnard was trying to pierce the future as he sat
in his sitting-room, the cold, gray dawn creeping
through the window blinds, and he smoked innumerable
cigarettes with nervous rapidity. His roving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>eyes restlessly examining each familiar piece of furniture,
finally lighted on the huge antique sofa near by.
Instead of having legs, the base of the sofa was a
carved sphinx, a sadly battered sphinx, whose two
breasts had been cut off because Barnard’s spinster
aunts had deemed them immodest!</p>

<p>Just as Barnard lighted another cigarette, a man,
lying on the sofa, rolled over and viewed him in
stupid wonder.</p>

<p>“Feeling better, Cooper?” inquired Barnard
politely.</p>

<p>“How’d I get here?” asked Joe, ignoring the
other’s question. “And where am I, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“These are my diggings, and I brought you
over here because you were so hopelessly pickled
I judged your sister had better be spared a glimpse
of you.”</p>

<p>Slowly memory of the night returned to Joe’s
befuddled brain, and he sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>“Washington isn’t so slow,” he volunteered, after
due reflection.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of people to help you go to the
devil, here as elsewhere,” retorted Barnard. “Better
pull up, Cooper, it doesn’t pay.”</p>

<p>“Nothing pays,” Joe growled disconsolately.
“D&mdash;mn it, man, I don’t want to listen to a temperance
lecture,” and he rose a trifle unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Cooper,” Barnard scanned him contemptuously,
and Joe sulkily resumed his seat. “I’ve
said my say.”</p>

<p>“Lot’s of snobs here,” commented Joe, after nursing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
his grievances in silence for some time. “Take
Duncan Fordyce, for instance; turned me down this
evening when I asked to be introduced to a girl he
was dancing with. I’ll get even with him, never
fear.”</p>

<p>Barnard ran an appraising eye over his companion,
and a mental picture of Duncan brought a smile
to his lips. “Don’t try any hanky-panky business with
Fordyce,” he advised. “He might knock you into
the other world.”</p>

<p>“I’m not such a fool as to try physical force; but
there are other ways of getting even,” Joe frowned,
then winked. “I know a thing or two about the
Fordyce family.”</p>

<p>Barnard blew ring after ring of smoke into the
air and watched it evaporate with idle attention.</p>

<p>“Go carefully, Cooper,” he cautioned. “Damages
for slander are heavy.”</p>

<p>“It’s no slander, but gospel truth,” affirmed Joe.
“I had it straight from mother’s friend, Mrs.
Watson, who was companion to Mrs. Fordyce before
they went abroad, and I know it’s true by the
way Duncan Fordyce acted when he heard me allude
to the kink in his family,” and in a few words he
described the scene in the Turkish Bath.</p>

<p>“That explains Fordyce’s lack of cordiality at
Captain Nichol’s quarters after the drill,” commented
Barnard. “If I were you, Cooper, I’d steer clear of
arousing his wrath.”</p>

<p>“He can’t injure me,” Joe swaggered with the
courage induced by overindulgence. “And you’ve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>been mighty white this evening; it’s only right I
should tip you off.”</p>

<p>“Keep your confidences to yourself,” Barnard rose
and kicked the fire into a brighter blaze. “The
matter does not concern me.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it, eh? Well, if I was planning to marry
a girl, an’ I heard her family were dotty&mdash;&mdash;” he
stopped and shrank back as Barnard swung on him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by your damnable insinuation?”
he demanded, his eyes flashing with indignation.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a ’sinuation; it’s&mdash;it’s gospel truth I’m
telling you,” stuttered Joe, retreating to the farther
end of the sofa. “Take your hand off my collar.
Anybody in San Francisco’ll tell you the Fordyces
are all crazy.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said too much, and too little,” Barnard
slowly returned to his chair. “Go ahead and make
good your statement, if you can,” significantly. “And
I warn you if I catch you lying, I won’t leave it to
Duncan Fordyce to finish you off.”</p>

<p>“Nice way to talk to a friend who wants to do
you a good turn,” whined Joe. “You can prove
what I say by writing to Mrs. Watson at Santa
Barbara. She says whenever any member of the
Fordyce family dies the physicians have to cauterize
them&mdash;what do you make of that?” triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Only a precautionary measure to test death,”
said Barnard calmly. “I suppose the Fordyces have
a dread of being buried alive.”</p>

<p>“That applies to their mental condition&mdash;&mdash;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>Barnard shook his head in utter disbelief, and Joe
continued heatedly. “I tell you they are unbalanced;
why the old lady, Mrs. Fordyce&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is a hunchback, yes,” admitted Barnard. “She
was injured in a railroad accident&mdash;that has nothing
to do with mental trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been told that injury to the spine does often
affect the brain,” Joe stuck obstinately to his contention.
“Anyway Mrs. Fordyce developed a
mighty funny craze about dirt.”</p>

<p>“Dirt?” Barnard’s attention was fully aroused.
“Do you mean she has mysophobia?”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s the word; what does it mean exactly?”</p>

<p>“Mysophobia? A morbid fear of contamination&mdash;of
soiling one’s hands by touching anything....”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed Joe. “Mrs. Fordyce has
a bad case of it. Mrs. Watson said she insisted on
washing her plates, knives, and forks before eating;
and she gave up traveling because of the dirt and
dust which nearly drove her mad, and just shut
herself up.”</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” ejaculated Barnard compassionately.
“She must be in perpetual torment.”</p>

<p>“She’s tormented other people as well,” said Joe.
“She grew so that she wouldn’t touch money; and
once she gave away a soiled dollar bill to a beggar
to get rid of it, then nearly had brain fever because
she imagined she had passed on some disease to innocent
people. I believe Calderon Fordyce spent a
hundred just to trace that one dollar bill to have it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>returned to the United States Treasury and redeemed,
before his wife got over the worrying about
her sinfulness in passing along dirty money. I wish
she’d get rid of some of it in my direction.”</p>

<p>“Dirt to dirt,” Barnard’s sneering tone was lost
on Joe, who was busy searching his empty pockets.
“There is nothing discreditable to the Fordyces in
what you have told me, Cooper; quite to the contrary.
And while Mrs. Fordyce suffers from a
curious mania, possibly superinduced by her accident,
she is not mentally unbalanced, and most certainly
her condition will not be inherited by her children.
Janet told me she and Duncan were born before the
accident.”</p>

<p>“They may not inherit that particular craze,”
acknowledged Joe. “But I tell you, man, there is
insanity in the family. There is some story about
Janet; I don’t know exactly what it is, but Pauline
can tell you. She heard it from a schoolmate of
Janet’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And she heard it from someone else, and so on,
and so on&mdash;bosh! utter bosh!” Barnard brought
down his clenched fist on the table with a force that
made the glasses ring. “If I hear you repeating
this rot I’ll make Washington too hot to hold you,”
and cowed by his blazing wrath, Joe mumbled a
hasty promise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Across Rock Creek the city lights were paling, and
the cold gray dawn found Marjorie still crouching
before the dying embers of a grate fire, where she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>had thrown herself on entering her bedroom some
hours before. Slowly, very slowly her numbed senses
grasped the significance of the occurrences of the
night. Janet Fordyce was a kleptomaniac, and she,
Marjorie Langdon, was branded a thief&mdash;caught
with the goods! She shuddered in horror, and rubbed
one cold hand over the other. Surely her God was a
just God? Why was she picked out to be the victim
of circumstance? First, Admiral Lawrence had
believed her guilty of theft, and now Mrs. Walbridge
had practically ordered her from her house
as a thief. Of the theft of the codicil she could give
no explanation, but she could at least clear herself
of the charge of stealing the diamond sunburst by
denouncing Janet.</p>

<p>Ah, but could she? Her dazed wits invariably
returned to that point in her reasoning; was she not
in honor bound to shield Janet? Mrs. Fordyce had
taken her word in the face of her discharge from
Admiral Lawrence’s employ. Since being with Janet
she had met with every courtesy and kindness, and
Mrs. Fordyce had gone out of her way to make her
feel at home. No, a thousand times no, she could
never betray Janet.</p>

<p>Her decision reached, a feeling of relief swept
over her, to be checked the next moment by the realization
that even if she did denounce Janet she
would not be believed. She was poor, she needed
money, she had the opportunity, and she stole; so
would read the verdict. Janet had but to ask, and a
dozen diamond sunbursts, if need be, would be purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to gratify her whim. She did not need to
steal.</p>

<p>Marjorie rose slowly to her feet and stretched
her stiff muscles, switched on the light, and then
commenced to undress, but she gave little thought
to what she was doing, her entire attention being
taken up in trying to recall what she knew of kleptomania.
She remembered being told that it was a
mental derangement, an irresistible propensity to
steal, and that the kleptomaniac cared nothing for
the objects stolen as soon as the impulse to steal was
gratified. Her father had once told her of a friend
who would eat no food that was not stolen, and
his servants (fortunately he was wealthy) had to
secrete food about the house and permit him to
steal it before he would satisfy his hunger. She
had also read somewhere of a kleptomaniac so obsessed
by his craze that he stole the crucifix from his
confessor.</p>

<p>Merry, charming Janet to be the victim of such
mental disorder! Marjorie wrung her hands in
agony. Was there no way to help the child? If
the news ever leaked out it would kill her delicate
mother.</p>

<p>Marjorie, pleading her indisposition, had left
Janet at the dance under Duncan’s care, and a sympathetic
footman having engaged a cab for her, she
had returned at once to the Fordyce residence.
Some hours later Janet had rapped at her door and
asked how she was, and satisfied with Marjorie’s
answer, had gone straight to her room without entering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
to Marjorie’s intense relief; she would have
broken down if she had faced her then.</p>

<p>Marjorie was about to get into bed when she spied
a note addressed to her lying on top of a neat package
on her bedstead. Sitting down on the edge of
the bed, she tore open the envelope and listlessly
read the few written lines; then, startled, read them
a second and third time. The note was from her
clergyman informing her that the contents of the
accompanying package had been found the Sunday
before in the Fordyce pew, and he thought it best
to send them to her that she might return the property
to the rightful owner.</p>

<p>The note slipped unheeded to the floor, and with
trembling fingers she tore open the bundle, and out
fell a dozen or more handsome silk and lace doilies.
Not one was alike, and a cry of horror broke from
Marjorie, as, picking them up, she recognized them
as belonging to hostesses with whom she and Janet
had recently lunched and dined.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Lawrence.</span> On Monday, December 24, Margaret A.,
beloved wife of Stephen Lawrence, Rear Admiral, U. S. N.,
aged sixty-two years. Funeral from her late residence on

</div>

<p>Chichester Barnard stared at the printed notice in
the death column, then let the newspaper slip from
his fingers to the floor. On looking up he caught the
direct gaze of Duncan Fordyce, who had entered the
smoking-room some time before, and was observing
his changing countenance with some secret astonishment.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fordyce,” Barnard pulled himself together.
“Sorry I didn’t see you before, but this
confounded paper gave me a shock.”</p>

<p>“No bad news I hope?” inquired Duncan, placing
a stamp on the letter he took from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Just read the notice of my aunt’s death,” and as
Duncan murmured some conventional condolences,
he added, “Aunt Margaret was very decent to me,
but since her second marriage, I’ve seen very little
of her. She was really only my aunt by courtesy;
her first husband having been my uncle, Dimintry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>Barnard. Admiral Lawrence wasn’t adverse to picking
up a rich widow; I reckon he’ll inherit a pot of
money now. How is your sister today?”</p>

<p>“Rather tired after the Walbridge dance,” Duncan
yawned, then laughed. “Washington hours are
too much for me. I don’t see how the men here go
out to entertainments and do their work.”</p>

<p>“They try it for a couple of years, and then give
up society, at least the dancing end of it. Has Miss
Langdon recovered from her indisposition of last
night?”</p>

<p>“She was down bright and early this morning,”
replied Duncan indifferently. “She appeared to be
all right and in good spirits.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. By the way, she will be sorry to
hear of Mrs. Lawrence’s death; she was the Admiral’s
secretary for several years.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” Duncan yawned again. “Is Admiral
Lawrence still on the active list?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he retired five or six years ago. Where
are you going?” as Duncan rose.</p>

<p>“Haven’t decided; think I’ll stroll around the
Speedway.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment and I’ll go with you,” volunteered
Barnard, and Duncan halted uncertainly. “I
must write a line to Admiral Lawrence and ask if
there’s anything I can do; it won’t take me long.”
He was as good as his word, and after dispatching
the hastily scrawled note by a messenger, he and
Duncan left the Metropolitan Club and turned down
Seventeenth Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>It was the first time that Duncan had had more
than five minutes conversation alone with Barnard
since their meeting, and he found him a far more
agreeable companion than he had anticipated. Barnard,
when he chose, was a brilliant talker, and his
comments on the world in general and Washington
in particular elicited amused chuckles from Duncan
as they strolled along the picturesque driveway which
skirts the Potomac River. But strive as he would, he
could not drag Duncan out of his shell; every time
he skillfully led the conversation to the Fordyces and
their plans for the future, Duncan retired into his
habitual reserve. Returning up Eleventh Street,
Barnard paused at the corner of Pennsylvania
Avenue.</p>

<p>“You know Madame Yvonett, Miss Langdon’s
aunt, do you not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, I was not at home when she called on my
mother.”</p>

<p>“Then you have missed meeting one of the most
charming characters in this city,” exclaimed Barnard
vigorously. “Come with me now and we’ll stop in
and wish the dear old lady merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>But Duncan held back. “I am afraid I....”</p>

<p>“Oh, come along; we need only stay a moment.
Your calling will gratify Madame Yvonett. I overheard
her asking Miss Langdon to bring you to see
her.”</p>

<p>Duncan’s indecision vanished. “Very well,” he
said, and the two men continued their walk up the
Avenue to Thirteenth Street. They found the small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>house gay with Christmas wreaths, and a stiff and
starched Minerva ushered them into Madame
Yvonett’s presence. Duncan’s eyes brightened in
keen appreciation as he bowed low before the stately
Quakeress. In fichu and cap, tied with a dainty
bow under her chin, and her soft gray silk, she looked
the embodiment of beautiful old age.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to meet thee, Friend Fordyce,” she
said, giving him her hand. “Thy sister, Janet, has
spoken of thee most often.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to come before,” Duncan drew up a
chair near her, “but a great deal of my time has been
taken up with business.”</p>

<p>“Business!” echoed Barnard, genuinely surprised.
“I took you for a gentleman of elegant leisure, didn’t
you, Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I what?” inquired Marjorie, entering
from the dining-room where she had been putting the
finishing touches to the tea-table.</p>

<p>“Did you know our friend here,” waving his hand
toward Duncan, “is a hardy son of toil?”</p>

<p>Marjorie laughed. “Janet told me, Mr. Fordyce,
that you have explored....”</p>

<p>“I have ambled about a bit,” admitted Duncan
hastily. “But I am not an explorer, only a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? I had no idea of it!” answered Marjorie.
“Aunt Yvonett, the eggnog is ready.”</p>

<p>“Will thee come, friend, and drink a kindly glass
with me?” asked the Quakeress, laying her hand
on Duncan’s arm.</p>

<p>“Gladly,” and he led her into the dining-room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>and to her high-back chair. Barnard detained Marjorie
as she was about to follow her aunt.</p>

<p>“Have you no word of greeting for me?” he
pleaded, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she cautioned. “Why did you bring Mr.
Fordyce here?”</p>

<p>Barnard glanced at her flushed cheeks in some surprise.
“We were walking together, and I suddenly
hungered for a sight of you. I then recollected having
heard you say that you were coming here to be
with your aunt this afternoon, so I suggested dropping
in.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Chichester, is that chattel mortgage all
arranged?” she asked in an urgent whisper.</p>

<p>He nodded affirmatively, and her heart bounded
with relief. “I’ll bring you the papers; stay, on second
thought you had better come to the office.” He saw
the shadow that crossed her face, and added reproachfully,
“Am I so hateful to you?”</p>

<p>“That’s a debatable question,” she parried, avoiding
his glance. By an effort he checked a bitter
retort as she pulled back the portière, and, his face
resuming its customary smiling mask, he followed
her into the dining-room.</p>

<p>They found Madame Yvonett deep in conversation
with Duncan.</p>

<p>“Thee sees we have friends in common,” she announced,
filling two glasses with the frothy beverage
before her. “Help thyself to the sandwiches, Friend
Barnard.” In spite of Chichester Barnard’s many
attempts to ingratiate himself with the Quakeress,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>she had never dropped the formal address with him,
although she had known his relatives for many years.
“Where is thy Cousin Rebekah, Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“I ’specs dat’s Miss Becky at de do’ now,” volunteered
Minerva, emerging from the pantry as the
bell sounded. “She done said she’d be back drickly.”</p>

<p>“Ask her to come right in here,” called Madame
Yvonett. “Ah, Becky,” seeing the spinster appear
in the doorway. “Thee must be cold, come and have
a glass of eggnog.”</p>

<p>But Miss Rebekah declined the offer with some
asperity; she considered eggnog the “devil’s brew,”
and, but that a certain fear of Madame Yvonett’s
displeasure restrained her, would then and there have
delivered a forceful homily on strong drink. She
had met Chichester Barnard on previous visits, and
was a staunch admirer of the handsome lawyer,
whose resemblance to her hero, Byron, made a
strong appeal to her latent sentimentality. He
greeted her warmly, and after Duncan was introduced,
placed a chair for her next his own.</p>

<p>“Where has thee been, Becky?” asked Madame
Yvonett, turning back from giving directions to
Minerva to bring the spinster a cup of weak tea.</p>

<p>“I ran over to ask Admiral Lawrence if there was
anything I could do for him,” explained Miss Rebekah.
“Margaret Lawrence was my cousin, and
being her only relative in Washington I thought it
was the least I could do.”</p>

<p>“Was she not related to thee, Friend Barnard?”
inquired Madame Yvonett, turning to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“I was only her nephew by marriage, but she was
a good friend to me.” The regret in his voice and
manner rang true, even to Marjorie’s watchful ears.
“Mrs. Lawrence was a noble woman, and will be
missed by many.”</p>

<p>“She was very, very good to me,” a lump rose in
Marjorie’s throat, and she hastily cleared her voice.
“Did you learn any particulars of her death, Cousin
Becky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw the nurse.” Miss Rebekah was in
her element. She enjoyed nothing so much as the
sound of her own voice, and particularly reveled in
funereal topics; she attended her relatives’ obsequies
both near and far, and the more harrowing the circumstances
surrounding their deaths, the more her
soul thrilled in morbid enjoyment. “The nurse&mdash;what’s
her name, Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Kathryn Allen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s she; such a pretty girl,” she interpolated.
“Well, Nurse Allen told me that Cousin
Margaret did not suffer toward the last; in fact,
that during the past six weeks she never regained
consciousness.”</p>

<p>“Never regained consciousness,” repeated Barnard
slowly. “What a blessed relief.”</p>

<p>“Yes, wasn’t it,” went on Miss Rebekah, addressing
him directly. “I knew you would understand.
Poor Cousin Margaret was in torment until she
became delirious and later lapsed into a comatose
condition. I saw Admiral Lawrence for a few
minutes; he inquired particularly for you, Marjorie,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>and desired to know where you could be found
quickly.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” A faint, very faint inflection of fear in the
monosyllable caught Duncan’s quick ear, and he
darted a keen look at Marjorie, but she was crumbling
the end of her sandwich between her fingers,
and he learned nothing from her blank expression.</p>

<p>“I suppose he wanted to get you to answer notes,
and attend to things generally,” continued Miss Rebekah,
pouring out a cup of tea from the pot Minerva
set before her. “I told the Admiral where you were,
Marjorie, and how kind Mrs. Fordyce has been to
you. I went quite into details,” she smiled at Duncan.
“I even mentioned some of the things Marjorie
told me about you....”</p>

<p>“Cousin Becky,” Marjorie looked as angry as she
felt. “You certainly are an&mdash;&mdash;” catching her aunt’s
warning look, she held back the words “unmitigated
nuisance” with which she had intended finishing her
sentence.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I went into particulars because
it took the Admiral’s mind away from his sorrow,”
continued Miss Rebekah, her air of self-congratulation
upon her tact causing Duncan to smile covertly.
“And he was very interested in hearing all about
your good fortune, Marjorie, and said he was sorry
Mrs. Fordyce hadn’t written him to ask about
you&mdash;&mdash;” Marjorie set down her eggnog glass
with a thud, she had drunk the delicious concoction at
a gulp, and was grateful for the warmth which stole
through her chilled body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“How is thy good mother?” asked Madame
Yvonett, addressing Duncan. “I hoped that she
would come in this afternoon and help me keep the
Yuletide; thee sees, this is the only day I indulge in
such dissipation,” touching the punch bowl.</p>

<p>“If mother went anywhere, I know she would
come to you, Madame Yvonett; but she insists on
being a recluse.” Barnard, conversing with Miss
Rebekah, gave part of his attention to Duncan’s
remarks. Joe Calhoun-Cooper’s confidences were
fresh in his memory. “I wish you could induce
mother to see more of her friends.”</p>

<p>“It is not good for any of us to live within
ourselves,” acknowledged the gentle Quakeress.
“A little natural diversion fits us for the ills of life.
But thy mother lives so for others, she is never
alone.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered Duncan heartily. “But
of late years I have been so little with my family, I
perhaps notice mother’s withdrawal more than my
father and sister.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what has become of Janet,” chimed
in Marjorie, looking with some uneasiness at
Duncan. “She said she would join me here at five
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I left her reading in the library.” Duncan
looked at his watch. “It is after six.”</p>

<p>“So late!” Barnard rose in some haste. “I am
afraid I shall have to leave as I am dining with
friends at Chevy Chase, and I have barely time to
dress and get there. Madame Yvonett, it is always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>such a pleasure to see you; I hope you will let me
come again soon.”</p>

<p>“Thee is very welcome,” responded Madame
Yvonett kindly, and with a quick word of farewell
to the others, Barnard took his departure.</p>

<p>As the front door banged shut, Marjorie lifted
her furs and coat from the chair where she had
thrown them. “I really must go,” she said, and kissing
her aunt affectionately, she whispered low, “don’t
let Cousin Becky torment the life out of you.”</p>

<p>“Tut, child, she is one of my diversions,” whispered
back Madame Yvonett placidly. “Never take
Becky seriously, nor any other troubles,” glancing
anxiously at the dark circles under Marjorie’s eyes.
“God guard thee in His Holy care,” she murmured,
and held Marjorie close, then pushed her gently from
her. “Thee must not tarry. Friend Fordyce,” as
Duncan advanced to bid her good-night, “thy coming
has given me much pleasure....”</p>

<p>“May I come again?”</p>

<p>“Thee may indeed,” with a cordiality that matched
his eagerness. “Give this sprig of mistletoe,” breaking
off a piece from the small branch suspended from
the newel post, “to thy mother with the season’s
greetings.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Duncan pocketed the tiny sprig with
care, and shaking hands with Miss Rebekah, who
hovered in the background, he returned to Marjorie’s
side. “Shall we walk or ride?” he asked, as
the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>“Have we time to walk?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Plenty,” and with a strange, shy reluctance Marjorie
accompanied him across Franklin Square and
up Fourteenth Street to Massachusetts Avenue.
“Where did you get your seven-league boots?” he
asked, breaking the prolonged silence.</p>

<p>“One has to have them to keep up with you,” she
retorted.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” slacking his pace. “I did
not realize&mdash;&mdash;” he again relapsed into silence, and
Marjorie’s thoughts flew swiftly to Janet and the
problems which confronted her.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the doilies she had spent
the early hours of the morning trying to devise some
plan to assist Janet; at all hazards the girl must be
protected against her curious craze, but how&mdash;how?
Madame Yvonett was the only one she could confide
in, and she had gone there early that afternoon
hoping to see her aunt alone, but old friends had
called, and the time had passed without giving her
an opportunity to ask her advice. A whisper of
kleptomania, and Janet’s fair name would be bandied
from door to door in scandal-loving Washington.</p>

<p>“Have you spent all your life in this city?” asked
Duncan, with such abruptness that Marjorie started
perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no,” she stammered, the question taking
her by surprise. “I used to go every summer to our
New England home, but Aunt Yvonett prefers returning
to Philadelphia whenever I&mdash;I&mdash;have a vacation.”
She did not add that lack of funds had
made them all the year residents of the National
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>Capital, but Duncan guessed the reason underlying
her slight hesitancy. Was there no way to win her
confidence?</p>

<p>“How long were you Admiral Lawrence’s secretary?”</p>

<p>“Over two years,” shortly; then a sudden thought
struck her. “Do you know Admiral Lawrence?”
and the darkness hid her loss of color.</p>

<p>“I met him when he was with the Pacific fleet, and
before his promotion to rear-admiral. He has the
reputation of being a fine type of an American naval
officer.”</p>

<p>“Have you met him recently?”</p>

<p>“I? No. Take care of that curb.” She stumbled
somewhat and he assisted her across the street. “My
father entertained the officers of the fleet whenever
they came to San Francisco, but I doubt if Admiral
Lawrence will remember me. I only saw him when
home on my college vacations.”</p>

<p>Marjorie heaved a sigh of relief; she dreaded his
hearing of Admiral Lawrence’s charge against her,
for she feared his condemnation. In their daily
intercourse she had gradually realized that the silent,
reserved man had high ideals and exacted a high
standard in his friends. His altered manner of the
past week had hurt as well as piqued her; until then
she had taken his companionship and good opinion
as a matter of course. Duncan was some eight years
Janet’s senior, and his silent watchfulness had contributed
to Marjorie’s success as a chaperon. He
had insisted that his sister show her every consideration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and that her advice should be followed in all
social matters. She could ill afford to lose such a
friend.</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you to call on Aunt Yvonett,”
she said, changing the subject abruptly.</p>

<p>“I had intended to go before this,” replied Duncan
courteously. “Mother and Janet have spoken
so frequently of Madame Yvonett that I have been
very anxious to meet her.”</p>

<p>“Everyone loves Aunt Yvonett,” answered Marjorie
warmly. “I wish my fairy godmother had
bequeathed me her power of fascination.” Duncan
made no reply, and Marjorie ran up the short flight
of steps of the Fordyce home, and laid an impatient
finger on the electric bell.</p>

<p>“I have my key,” remonstrated Duncan, pulling
it out and opening the front door. “I hope our long
walk hasn’t tired you,” as she stepped past him into
the house.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” pausing in the hall while he divested
himself of his overcoat. “I feel as fresh as a daisy.”</p>

<p>Duncan inspected her carefully, from her well-shod
feet to her imperiously carried head, and he was
conscious of an accelerated pulse as he caught the
full witchery of her lovely eyes. He stepped swiftly
to her side, a longing to touch her, to hold her in
his arms overmastered him.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Janet can be,” she said, the
coquetry dropping from her, as her anxieties returned.
“Do ask Perkins if she is in the house.”</p>

<p>Duncan drew back. “Janet? Do you think of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>no one but Janet?” and without waiting for an
answer he walked down the hall, but before he left
her, Marjorie had seen in Duncan’s eyes the message
which every daughter of Eve translates by
instinct. With strangely fluttering heart she sought
her room and in that safe haven paused for breath.
Day-dreams were not for her; she was only his
mother’s paid employee, and ... one man had
not scrupled to lie to her....</p>

<p>Over in Georgetown, Barnard, in immaculate evening
dress, opera hat and overcoat, paused to light
another cigarette. “So Aunt Margaret never regained
consciousness,” he said aloud. “<i>What</i> a
relief!”</p>

<span class="smaller">A TANGLED WEB</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">E</span>arlier</span> that same afternoon Janet had
started for Madame Yvonett’s residence intending
to join Marjorie there, but as she
crossed Dupont Circle into Massachusetts Avenue,
an automobile drew up alongside the curb, and a
cheery voice hailed her.</p>

<p>“This is luck,” exclaimed Tom Nichols, springing
out of his roadster, and clasping her hand warmly.
“Where are you going Miss Janet?”</p>

<p>“Down to see Madame Yvonett,” Janet’s piquant
face dimpled into a smiling welcome.</p>

<p>“Fine! I was just on the way to her house myself;
jump in and I’ll take you there.”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks.” Janet climbed into the motor
car, and after arranging the rug over her lap, Tom
took his seat behind the steering wheel, and in a
second more they were off. At the corner of Scott
Circle Tom slackened speed.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go for a spin first,” he coaxed. “It’s
a glorious day for a run in the country.”</p>

<p>“But I promised to meet Marjorie&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, so you can,” cutting her objection short.
“If we get there by half-past five it will be time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>enough; Cousin Yvonett always has a late dinner.
Besides, it’s always better to be late at a party, it insures
a warm welcome.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes too warm a one,” laughed Janet
“What will mother say to my going motoring with
you and leaving Marjorie behind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, your mother won’t mind, I’m only Marjorie’s
cousin,” carelessly. “I’m sure your physician will
prescribe plenty of ozone after last night’s dance,
and the air’s glorious today, do come?”</p>

<p>Janet wavered. She was pretty certain her mother
would not approve, but&mdash;it was a perfect winter’s
day, clear and bracing; she was tired of a stuffy
house, and then&mdash;and then she admired and liked
Tom Nichols. Her warm blood pulsed a trifle faster,
then ebbed more slowly. Was it disloyal to
Chichester Barnard to crave the presence of another
man? She put the thought from her with frowning
impatience.</p>

<p>“I can go a little distance,” she conceded.</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” and the glance he turned on her
held more than admiration. “Will you be warm
enough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, plenty,” Janet pulled the collar of her fur
coat up about her ears, and snuggled back in her seat,
the heavy laprobe drawn tightly in place.</p>

<p>“These side doors keep out the drafts,” as he
spoke Tom swung his car around the circle and continued
down the avenue. “How would you like to
go out to Bladensburg and see the battlefield?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that too far?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“No; it’s only about five miles from here, we’ll
do it in no time,” and not waiting for an answer,
Tom accelerated the motor, and they shot past
several carriages and automobiles. In a short time
he swung the car into H Street. That thoroughfare
being comparatively free of traffic, he turned to his
silent companion. “Why did Marjorie leave the
dance so early last night?”</p>

<p>“She had a bad sick headache, poor dear,” with
careless compassion. “I don’t think Marjorie’s very
strong.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t exactly robust, but I wouldn’t call her
delicate,” replied Tom. “How is she today?”</p>

<p>“Apparently all right again,” Janet filled her lungs
with delicious cold air. “Mother says Marjorie has
too much on her mind; perhaps that is the reason she
is so distrait lately.”</p>

<p>“It must be that, usually she is the cheeriest soul
imaginable,” Tom sounded his siren as he cut across
an intersecting street. “I’m afraid Marjorie sees
too much of&mdash;&mdash;” he stopped, and his face clouded.
His code of honor prevented him from running
down a possible rival behind his back; and rumor
had it that Janet was captivated by Barnard’s handsome
face and charm of manner, nor could he hurt
her by speaking of Barnard’s past infatuation for
Marjorie. It would not be playing fair to Marjorie;
he could not make trouble between the two girls.
In his heart he vowed Barnard should not win
Janet. “Marjorie has seen too much of hard
times,” he amended. “Financial difficulties play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>hob with a person’s physical and mental condition.”</p>

<p>“Mental condition,” repeated Janet thoughtfully.
“I wonder if that accounts for&mdash;&mdash;take care&mdash;&mdash;oh,
why will children play in the streets?” as Tom
swerved the car just in time to avoid running over a
little pickaninny.</p>

<p>“Sorry I frightened you,” he said contritely, turning
the car into the Bladensburg Pike. “Have you
ever been out this way?”</p>

<p>“No. Where did you say we are going?”</p>

<p>“Bladensburg; it’s a quaint old-fashioned little
town and of historic interest because the Battle of
Bladensburg was fought there in 1814....”</p>

<p>“When the British defeated our troops and captured
Washington?”</p>

<p>“Correct. I’m glad to see, Miss Janet, you know
American history. Not long ago I was asked to meet
some <i>nouveaux riches</i> at dinner, and an American
girl, who is now an English countess, broke into a
discussion about Gettysburg to ask in a soft drawl:
‘Gettysburg? What <i>is</i> Gettysburg?’”</p>

<p>They had left the city’s unattractive outskirts behind,
and were passing through more open country,
and Janet, delighted and light-hearted, sat silently
watching the landscape with ever-increasing interest.</p>

<p>“There’s Bladensburg,” Tom pointed to the church
spires and roofs of houses showing plainly among
the leafless trees. “These houses,” motioning to his
right, “are some of them very old, the estates having
been owned by prominent colonials.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s the battlefield?”</p>

<p>“Right here,” indicating the road they were on.
“The fighting began beyond the further bridge spanning
the eastern branch of the Potomac, and our
troops fell back through the village and down this
turnpike, the British in hot pursuit.”</p>

<p>Janet’s active imagination instantly conjured up
a vision of the fighting, flying men, and the quiet
sleepy Maryland village became transformed to her;
she could almost hear the rattle of muskets, hoarse
commands, and the roar of cannon, so vivid was the
illusion.</p>

<p>Tom brought his car to a standstill at the side of
the road near a short bridge, and pointed to a dip in
the rolling meadow through which a creek meandered
in long and graceful curves.</p>

<p>“The famous dueling ground of Bladensburg,” he
explained. “It was there that Commodore Stephen
Decatur, the ‘Bayard of the Seas,’ met his brother
officer, James Barron, and fell mortally wounded by
him. I believe in those days trees masked the gully
from sight; anyway our fiery statesmen of the past
came out to this ‘field of honor’ to get satisfaction
from their enemies and traducers.”</p>

<p>“What excitement would ensue if they did it now!”
Janet thrilled at the thought.</p>

<p>“Congressmen of today belong to the ancient and
honorable order of ink-slingers,” answered Tom.
“This dueling ground never saw an opera bouffe
affair. Men here fought to kill, and generally succeeded
in their object.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t the Calvert Mansion somewhere in this
neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at Riverdale. It’s the Lord Baltimore Club
now. We’ll run up there and you can see it,” starting
the motor as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to be getting back,” said Janet
regretfully.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time,” eagerly. “Riverdale’s
only a little over a mile away; we’ll be there before
you know it.”</p>

<p>Tom kept the car down to reasonable speed while
passing through Bladensburg, then opened the throttle,
and they sped down the State road like an arrow
shot from a bow. Suddenly above the whistling of
the wind past his ears and the low hum of his straining
engine, Tom heard an authoritative hail and
discovered a rope stretched across the road some
distance ahead, and two constables on guard. Looking
backward he dimly made out, through the dust,
a motor cyclist following them, and realizing he was
in a trap, he brought his car to second speed.</p>

<p>“Stop your engine,” commanded the constable,
catching up with him.</p>

<p>Tom thought quickly. Had he been alone, he
would have tried to get away, but Janet’s presence
prevented any attempt at evading the law.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, constable?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The man laughed. “Speeding and joy-riding are
the charges.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come. I wasn’t breaking the regulations....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Tell that to the J. P.” At that moment the
second constable reached them, and sprang on
the running-board on Janet’s side of the car.
“Start her up again, and come into Hyattsville,”
directed the motor cyclist, and making the best
of a bad job, Tom sulkily obeyed the order.
Janet, her eyes wide with excitement, sat quietly
by his side. Pretending to tuck the laprobe
more securely about her, he whispered in her
ear:</p>

<p>“If they ask who you are, don’t give your real
name.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she muttered, and remained passive
until the car, passing the lowered rope, reached
its destination, escorted by the two constables. They
bade Tom and Janet accompany them into the
presence of the Justice of the Peace. Mr. Lenox,
the gray-haired justice, heard the evidence against
them in ominous silence.</p>

<p>“What is your name, miss?” he inquired sternly.</p>

<p>“Marjorie Langdon,” answered Janet readily, and
Tom gave her an approving glance.</p>

<p>“Your residence?” Janet told him, and the Justice
turned to Tom.</p>

<p>“Name?” he snapped.</p>

<p>“Thomas Langdon Nichols, Captain &mdash;th Field
Artillery, stationed at Fort Myer, Va.”</p>

<p>“Any relation of Miss Langdon?”</p>

<p>“Her cousin,” steadily.</p>

<p>The Justice laid down his pen. “Fifty dollars,”
he announced, holding out his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Fifty dollars fine!” fumed Tom. “That’s perfectly
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” retorted the Justice. “I
recognize you, young man; this is the third time
you’ve been arrested speeding on the State
Road....”</p>

<p>“I haven’t; you’re mixing me up with someone
else....”</p>

<p>“That game won’t work,” the Justice shrugged his
shoulders contemptuously. “Your name’s entered on
the records; you’ve been warned and fined for small
sums, already. This joy-riding has got to stop.”</p>

<p>“I don’t joy-ride,” thundered Tom, catching
Janet’s amused smile. “I admit I’ve made good time
on several business trips to Baltimore....”</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of you,” commented the Justice
ironically. “Fifty dollars, please.”</p>

<p>“Dash it all! I haven’t that amount with me,”
pulling out his wallet he counted the bank notes in it.
“Here’s eighteen dollars,” he laid the money on the
desk, and searched his pockets carefully, finally producing
some small change. “This makes twenty-one
fifty,” stacking the silver in a neat pile on top of the
bank notes. “You’ll have to take that, and let me
bring back the rest tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars or jail!” and the Justice sat back
and regarded the raging officer with provoking
calmness.</p>

<p>“Will you take a check for the balance?” demanded
Tom, as soon as he could control his speech.</p>

<p>“Depends on your bank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Without replying, Tom went slowly through his
pockets, but he had left his check-book on his desk
at his quarters, and his search was a waste of time.
“Let me have a blank check on the American Security
and Trust Company?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Haven’t one,” answered the Justice curtly, and
forestalled further requests by adding, “Haven’t a
check on any bank but a Baltimore trust company;
guess you can’t draw on that, young man.”</p>

<p>Tom bit his lip savagely. “Can I use that telephone?”
he asked, nodding toward the instrument.</p>

<p>“Sure, if you’ll pay the tolls.”</p>

<p>Tom seized the desk instrument and put in a call
for Fort Myer, but it was some minutes before he
got his connection, only to learn that the officers he
wished to speak to were absent from their quarters.
With a smothered oath he hung up the receiver and
scowled at the Justice.</p>

<p>“Will you permit this young lady,” placing his
hand on Janet’s arm, “to return to Washington?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so damned pig-headed!” stormed Tom.
“I’ll stay here until I can get hold of the necessary
money. Miss Langdon’s presence is not
required.”</p>

<p>“I’m the best judge of that; and see here, mind
how you address me; I won’t stand being sworn at.”</p>

<p>Tom moved closer to Janet, and lowered his voice.
“I’m afraid it will be some time before I can get
money here from Fort Myer,” he whispered. “Hadn’t
I better call up your brother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Mercy, no; please don’t think of it!” protested
Janet, her eyes opening in fright. “Duncan is so
stern, he would never approve or understand my
motoring alone with you. We must get back without
letting him know anything about all this”&mdash;waving
her hand toward the Justice who, “clothed in a little
brief authority,” was thoroughly enjoying the situation.
His predecessor had been severely criticized
for his lax handling of the speeders who frequented
the state road between Baltimore and Washington,
and he was determined to establish a record for distributing
impartial justice on one and all. The fact
that one of the breakers of the speed law before him
was an officer of the United States Army and the
other a very pretty young girl did not in the least
influence him to be lenient.</p>

<p>One of the constables had remained in the room,
and had been an interested listener to all that transpired.
Janet’s distressed expression finally won him
over to her side.</p>

<p>“Say, Captain,” he began, “Ain’t you got a watch
you can put up, and redeem later?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head despondently as his fingers
sought his watch pocket “It’s at Galt’s getting repaired,”
he replied.</p>

<p>Janet’s hopes, which had risen at the friendly constable’s
suggestion, sank like lead; then an idea occurred
to her, and she stepped up to the desk.</p>

<p>“Won’t you accept this as collateral?” she asked,
slipping a gold bracelet over her wrist and handing
it to the Justice. “Captain Nichols will bring you the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents tomorrow, and
get it back.”</p>

<p>Without answering, the Justice stooped and attentively
examined the handsome bauble in his hand.
The bracelet, of curious design, was studded with
diamonds and emeralds, and the Justice, who had
some knowledge of precious stones, was impressed
by its value. He turned the matter carefully over in
his mind before announcing his decision, and the
minutes seemed endless to Janet and Tom, who were
burning to get away.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it,” the Justice stated finally, laying the
bracelet carefully on the table and sweeping Tom’s
money into his cash box; then he laid the bracelet in
the box, and snapped the lid shut. He paused to
make an entry in his ledger, then turned back to
Tom. “Let this be a lesson to you,” he said severely.
“You’re an officer of Uncle Sam’s, and you of all
people ought to help preserve the Government’s
laws. This state road is not a race course. Good
evening.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back tomorrow,” called Tom from the
doorway, and he and Janet lost little time in getting
under way once again. The short afternoon had
come to a close, and Janet’s alarm grew as they
motored slowly out into the darkness.</p>

<p>“What shall I say to the family?” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Let me tell them the truth,” advised Tom. “It
was all my fault, I’ll take the blame.”</p>

<p>“Father will probably forbid my seeing you any
more,” answered Janet, dolefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Good Lord!” ejaculated Tom blankly; he felt
as if the earth had dropped from him. “But I must
see you, I&mdash;I&mdash;can’t get on without seeing you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” a little hope crept into her voice. “I&mdash;I&mdash;should
miss you awfully....”</p>

<p>“Would you?” Tom’s strong voice was husky. “I
feel like a brute to have gotten you into this scrape;
I must get you out of it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please do,” she pleaded, and stirred Tom’s brain
to quicker action.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go straight to Madame Yvonett’s,
spend a few minutes there; then if Marjorie hasn’t
waited for you, we’ll go right to your house, and explain
that we went down the streets Marjorie didn’t
return on&mdash;and so missed her.”</p>

<p>“That sounds a trifle involved,” Janet knitted her
brows in anxious thought. “However, I think it
will do, and no one need ever know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never tell,” promised Tom soothingly. “By
Jove! it was clever of you to give Marjorie’s name to
the J. P.; I’ll get back your bracelet tomorrow and
no one will be the wiser.”</p>

<p>“You are such a comfort,” sighed Janet; impulsively
Tom laid his right hand tenderly on hers. “I&mdash;I&mdash;always
enjoy myself when with you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour after Tom and Janet’s departure another
“speeder” was brought before Mr. Lenox, Justice of
the Peace for Hyattsville. But the tall, well-groomed,
middle-aged man who faced him, unlike
Tom wasted no time in disputing the fine imposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Can you change a twenty dollar bill?” he inquired,
drawing out a well-filled wallet. “This is
the first time I’ve motored down from Baltimore,
and I’m sorry my chauffeur broke the speed laws.
Hope of a Christmas dinner at home is my excuse.”</p>

<p>“Can’t blame you much,” acknowledged the Justice,
his sternness thawed by the other’s geniality.
“Let’s see if I have change,” opening his cash box,
and dumping its contents on the desk. The stranger
picked up Janet’s bracelet as it rolled toward him, and
glanced idly at it; then his attention was arrested by
the unusual design, and he examined it minutely, even
to the tiny initials and date engraved on the inside.
“Here’s your change, sir,” added the Justice.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” the stranger pocketed the money without
counting it. “Pretty bracelet you have here,”
handing it back to Lenox as he spoke. “Very unusual
in appearance; would you mind telling me where you
got it?”</p>

<p>“No, why should I? A girl, riding with her beau,
left it here in lieu of a fine for speeding. She, or
rather her escort, Captain Nichols, will redeem it
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I see,” the stranger stared in deep astonishment
at the Justice. “If it isn’t breaking a confidence,
can you give me the young woman’s name?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” the Justice rapidly ran his finger down
the open ledger. “Miss Marjorie Langdon, 910
Thirteenth Street, Washington.”</p>

<p>“Miss Marjorie Langdon,” repeated the stranger;
then roused himself. “Much obliged, sir, good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>evening.” And he hastily left the room and entered
his limousine. “Home, François,” he directed; then
as the lights of Hyattsville disappeared in the distance,
he confided his reflections to the flower-filled
glass vase. “What in the devil’s name was Miss
Marjorie Langdon doing with my daughter’s bracelet
in her possession?”</p>

<span class="smaller">DUNCAN’S DILEMMA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>auline Calhoun-Cooper</span> laid down
her embroidery with a resigned sigh as her
brother, after striding moodily up and
down the drawing-room, made a sudden dash for
the door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Joe?” she called.</p>

<p>“Out&mdash;&mdash;” and the front door banged shut behind
him.</p>

<p>Pauline’s lips curved in an irritating smile.
“Your ‘poy Joe’ gets more impossible every day,
mother. I think father had better be told&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No you don’t, young lady,” Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
spoke with unwonted authority. “I won’t
permit any further interference.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, take the consequences then,” replied
her daughter, undutifully. “Chichester Barnard
warned me Joe spends most of his time with that
trained nurse, Kathryn Allen; he said he couldn’t
tell <i>me</i> what kind of a character she is”&mdash;Pauline
raised her eyebrows suggestively.</p>

<p>Her mother reddened angrily. “I’ll thank Mr.
Barnard to mind his own business,” she snapped.
“Joe is too much of a gentleman to drop Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>Allen’s acquaintance after her kindness to him. He
tells me their friendship is entirely platonic.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Pauline’s sarcastic drawl was
enough to exasperate a far better tempered woman
than Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper. “Don’t blame me,
mother dear, if you get an undesirable daughter-in-law.”</p>

<p>Her mother’s retort was checked by the entrance
of Janet and Marjorie, and she rose somewhat
flurriedly to greet them.</p>

<p>“So good of you to call,” she cooed. “Pauline,
dear, you know Miss Langdon. Come and sit by
me, Miss Janet, and tell me of all your gay doings.
Joe will be so sorry to have missed you.”</p>

<p>“We caught a vanishing glimpse of him as we
drove up to the door,” Janet loosened her furs, for
the room was uncomfortably warm. “Are you going
to the Charity Ball on Monday evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have taken a box. Can’t you come with
us?” added Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper hospitably.</p>

<p>“Thanks very much, but I believe father has secured
a box also,” Janet smiled prettily upon her
hostess while her hand played nervously with the
silver ornaments on the tea-table. “I think it’s awfully
kind of you and your daughter to be so sweet
to me, a newcomer.”</p>

<p>Marjorie, sitting some distance from Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
and Janet, watched them anxiously,
and ignored Pauline’s decidedly cool manner and
curt speech. They talked on uninteresting topics for
some time, and Marjorie was on the point of rising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>to leave when she heard Janet accept Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s
offer of a cup of tea. She had neglected
to warn Janet before entering that they must make
their visit a short one, as their calling list that afternoon
was exceedingly long. There was nothing for
it but to wait until Janet had swallowed her exceedingly
hot cup of tea, which the butler had just brought
in, and concealing her impatience, she surrendered
herself to the inevitable.</p>

<p>“So sorry you had to leave the Walbridge dance,”
said Pauline, as conversation languished. “Miss
Fordyce tells me you are subject to&mdash;eh&mdash;headaches,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Headaches of the very worst kind,” acknowledged
Marjorie. Her eyes roved about the room,
which she had known so well when her aunt had
owned the house; even some of the furniture, many
pieces of which had been sold with the house, were
still in use in the drawing-room, and she had much
ado to keep back a rush of tears at the recollections
their presence gave her.</p>

<p>“I am told headaches are the bane of existence
as one advances in years,” said Pauline sweetly.
“Why, father!” as a tall man entered the room.
“What brings you home at this hour?”</p>

<p>“A moment’s leisure,” he replied. “How do you
do, Miss Fordyce,” shaking hands cordially with
Janet, and turning toward Marjorie. There was a
moment’s awkward pause, then Pauline remembered
her manners.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon, father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper stepped forward
and held out his hand as Marjorie rose and
advanced to meet him, “Miss Marjorie Langdon?”
he inquired, and she wondered faintly at the concentration
of his gaze.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, and her large hazel-gray
eyes smiled back at him with friendly interest. How
came so distinguished looking a man to have such an
impossible family?</p>

<p>“If I am not mistaken, you are related to Madame
Yvonett, are you not?” he asked, and again his keen
scrutiny swept over her.</p>

<p>“She is my great-aunt.”</p>

<p>“I gathered that was the relationship; please give
her my kind remembrances and say that I hope to
call soon.” Calhoun-Cooper turned back to his
wife. “Miss Langdon is a great-granddaughter of
Hugh Pemberton, who gave my father his start in
life,” he explained. “You must show every hospitality
to Miss Langdon, mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper, divided between vexation
at being called “mother” in public by her usually
thoughtful husband, and bewilderment at Marjorie’s
suddenly increased importance, clutched the tea-tray
in despair.</p>

<p>“Of course, John, of course,” she stammered.
“Dear Miss Langdon, will you have a cup of tea?
Where is them tongs?”</p>

<p>Janet, catching sight of Pauline’s furious expression,
almost laughed aloud. She covered her mouth
with her large muff, the better to conceal her amusement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Truly, Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s parts of
speech were flying to the four winds.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Marjorie gently. “But
I have had to give up drinking tea and coffee, Miss
Cooper,” addressing Pauline directly. “Mrs. Fordyce
wishes to know if you and your brother will
dine with her informally on Tuesday next?”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall any engagement for that night,”
Pauline slightly mollified, answered with more than
her usual warmth; a more intimate footing with the
Fordyce family counted for much in her social ambitions.
“Please tell Mrs. Fordyce that Joe and I
will be happy to come.”</p>

<p>“That is very nice,” smiled Marjorie. “Mrs.
Fordyce has sent you a formal invitation which you
will receive this evening, but she asked me to speak
of the matter as the time is short. Come, Janet, I
am afraid we must go. Good-bye, so glad we found
you.”</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper accompanied the two girls to
their limousine. “Don’t forget my message to your
aunt, Miss Langdon,” he said, as he closed the door
of the machine.</p>

<p>“Where next?” inquired Janet, as Marjorie consulted
her list.</p>

<p>“I think we had better leave cards at the White
House,” she said, and Janet, picking up the speaking
tube, gave the order, and the big car started down
Sixteenth Street.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Captain Nichols lately, Marjorie?”
asked Janet, breaking the brief pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t been near me.” Marjorie studied
Janet’s flushed face with keen attention. Could it
be possible that the young débutante was falling in
love with Tom? Had she lost interest in Chichester
Barnard? With all her heart Marjorie hoped such
was the case. Janet was too charming a girl to be
taken in by the wiles of a fortune hunter. To Marjorie’s
relief, she had seen nothing of Chichester
Barnard since meeting him at her aunt’s on Christmas
Day, nor had he called recently at the Fordyces.
It was not like him to be easily discouraged, he was
of the persevering kind, and Marjorie marveled at
his absence. Were Janet and he meeting clandestinely?
The thought sent a cold shiver down her back.
Abruptly she turned to Janet.</p>

<p>“Were you walking with Chichester Barnard yesterday?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Janet shortly, and again lapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>Janet’s thoughts at the moment were centered on
Tom Nichols, as they had been all too frequently of
late, considering she regarded herself secretly engaged
to Chichester Barnard. Though absent, the
latter’s daily notes, received surreptitiously, were a
constant reminder of her pledge to him. Barnard’s
charm of manner and conversation always left her
breathless, carried away by the fervor of his pleading,
but she turned restive under the exotic, extravagant
phrases which cloaked his passionate intentness
on paper. She longed for Tom’s breezy
wholesomeness and merry smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>On their return from Bladensburg she and Tom
had faithfully carried out their prearranged program,
and no question had been raised, so far as
Janet knew, as to where she had spent the early afternoon
on Christmas. But what was giving Janet more
concern than she had known in many years was the
fact that she had neither seen nor heard from Tom
since that afternoon, and that she had never received
back the diamond and emerald bracelet which she had
left with the Justice of the Peace at Hyattsville.
And Tom had promised to get it for her the very
next day!</p>

<p>“Did mother invite Captain Nichols to our dinner
next week?” she asked.</p>

<p>“She put his name on the list, but I didn’t get the
invitation written before we came out; however, I’ll
call him up tonight, and ask him verbally and send
him a reminder card later.”</p>

<p>“There’s Duncan!” exclaimed Janet, catching a
glimpse of her brother as the car turned the corner
into H Street. “I hope he won’t forget to order the
violets he promised me.”</p>

<p>Spying them at the same moment Duncan raised
his hat, and laughingly declining Janet’s frantic gesture
to join them, he continued on his way to the
Metropolitan Club. But at Seventeenth Street Tom
Nichols drew his roadster up in front of the curb,
and leaned forward to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Jump in and come over to the Army and Navy
Club with me,” he said, and Duncan, time hanging
heavy on his hands, accepted the invitation with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>alacrity. “I intended calling up your house, Fordyce,
to ask if your sister is home.”</p>

<p>“She’s out calling; I just saw her and Miss Langdon
in the limousine.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she can see me this evening?” Tom
swung his car into I Street.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, we are all dining at the British
Embassy. Will you be there?”</p>

<p>“Not invited,” replied Tom shortly. He parked
the roadster near the entrance to the club, and led
Duncan into one of the smoking-rooms. Duncan
found him singularly morose, and regarded the
usually jovial young officer in some perplexity; then
he concluded that Janet and Tom must have had a
squabble of some sort and that the latter was trying
to make up the quarrel.</p>

<p>Tom, in fact, was exceedingly disturbed. He had
just returned from Hyattsville, where he had redeemed
Janet’s bracelet. His duties at Fort Myer had
prevented his going there during the past two days,
and he had not dared to ask a brother officer to go in
his place, fearing news of the arrest for speeding
might leak out, with other details. He had hoped
to find Janet at home that afternoon and return the
bracelet. He had tried several times to talk to her
on the telephone, but each time the Fordyce servants
had told him Janet was either out or engaged. He
would have confided the whole affair to Marjorie
except for his promise to Janet.</p>

<p>“Can you go to the Charity Ball with us?” asked
Duncan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Why yes, I’d like to very much,” answered Tom,
awaking to the fact that he had not spoken for some
moments.</p>

<p>“Good, don’t trouble to get a ticket, and I
think you had better dine with us first&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Captain, but you are wanted on the
telephone,” interrupted a club attendant.</p>

<p>“I’ll be right back, Fordyce,” Tom sprang precipitously
to his feet; perhaps Janet had called him
up. “Wait for me,” and he disappeared after the
attendant.</p>

<p>An older man sitting by a window some distance
away glanced up at hearing the name “Fordyce,”
and scanned Duncan intently, then rose and slowly
approached him.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but are you not Duncan
Fordyce?” he asked.</p>

<p>Duncan looked at him attentively for a second,
then stepped forward.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Admiral Lawrence,” he said,
extending his hand.</p>

<p>The Admiral’s haggard face lighted with a pleased
smile. “So you remember me, Duncan; it’s some
years since we met,” a sigh accompanied the words.
“How is your dear mother?”</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you. Won’t you sit down, sir?”
pulling forward a chair.</p>

<p>“Please thank your mother for her kind note of
sympathy; I intended answering it&mdash;&mdash;” the Admiral
broke off abruptly and cleared his throat. “Tell
me of yourself, Duncan, since we last met.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“There’s nothing very much to recount, Admiral;
I graduated from Yale, then from the Harvard Law
School; traveled a bit in China and South America,
and on my return joined a law firm in San Francisco.
I am East on a short visit.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to have been so long,” said Tom, appearing
behind the Admiral, whom he already knew.
“Much obliged to you, sir, for taking care of Fordyce
in my absence.”</p>

<p>“Duncan and I are old friends,” Admiral Lawrence
stepped back. “I won’t interrupt you two any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t run away, Admiral,” protested Tom,
“it’s I who must be leaving. Hope you’ll forgive
me, Fordyce, but they’ve telephoned me
to return to Myer at once. Please tell Miss
Janet I’ll be in tomorrow.” He hesitated;
should he give the bracelet to Duncan? No.
Janet had particularly charged him not to let
any inkling of her motor ride reach her brother’s
ears, and Duncan would naturally ask him how he
came to have his sister’s bracelet in his possession.
“Ask her if she will telephone me what hour will
be most convenient for her to see me,” he added
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Duncan, turning back to say
good-bye to Admiral Lawrence.</p>

<p>“Can you spare me a few minutes now, Duncan?”
the latter asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; my time is at your disposal.”</p>

<p>Admiral Lawrence surveyed the room in silence;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>then led the way to the farther end, where two chairs
stood by themselves.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Duncan,” he said, dragging his seat
nearer the window. “We’re out of ear-shot over
here, and I’ve something important to say to you,”
he stopped, and Duncan waited respectfully for him
to continue. “I called up your house yesterday, and
your butler told me your father was out of town.”</p>

<p>“He went over to Philadelphia on business; we
are expecting him back tomorrow or next day.”</p>

<p>“I may not be in town when he returns; therefore
I must speak to you,” the Admiral paused, “about a
very delicate matter....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Duncan encouragingly, as his companion
again paused.</p>

<p>“Marjorie Langdon is in your mother’s employ,
is she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” But Duncan’s slight start was not observed
by the Admiral, who continued his questions.</p>

<p>“As companion to your sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Duncan for the third time.</p>

<p>The Admiral turned in his chair and made sure
that no one was in their vicinity, then leaned toward
Duncan. “Marjorie Langdon was my secretary for
the past two years; on November first, I discharged
her because I found she was a thief.”</p>

<p>For a second Duncan was blind to his surroundings.
But Admiral Lawrence read nothing of his
mental suffering in his expressionless face. Marjorie
then was really a thief! Marjorie, his ideal in
womanhood! His strong hands clenched themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>so tightly over the arms of his chair that the knuckles
shone white. He had succeeded in conquering the
suspicions he had harbored against Marjorie after
the mysterious disappearance of his father’s forty
dollars. Marjorie, if guilty of the theft of the
money, would never have mentioned the exact sum,
one hundred and fifty dollars, when she handed him
the bank notes to give his father. She <i>must</i> have
been innocent, he had reasoned, with dogged
determination. Now another man thought her a
thief!</p>

<p>“I would not have disclosed her true character
had I not heard that Marjorie was with your sister
continually,” said the Admiral slowly. “It is not
proper that a young girl should be subjected to
such contaminating influences.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” Duncan held up his hand protestingly.
“You have made a serious charge, Admiral,
against Miss Langdon; can you prove your statements?”</p>

<p>The Admiral whitened with anger. “I am not in
the habit of lying,” he retorted stiffly.</p>

<p>“Nor am I accusing you of lying,” calmly. “But
in my father’s absence you have come to me, as the
acting head of my house, to warn me against one of
my father’s employees. I am within my rights, sir,
in demanding your proofs that Miss Langdon is a
&mdash;&mdash;” Duncan choked over the word thief&mdash;“is not
a proper associate for my sister.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” admitted the Admiral,
his anger cooling. “I presume you have met my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>wife’s nephew by marriage, Chichester Barnard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“My wife, who has always been wealthy in her
own right, promised her first husband, Dimintry
Barnard, that she would leave one hundred thousand
dollars to his nephew, Chichester, whom he had
legally adopted, and in making her will some years
ago, she carried out her promise. Just before her
last illness, she quarreled with Chichester over some
unfortunate investments he had made for her, and
incensed by his manner, declared she would revoke
her bequest to him.</p>

<p>“On the last day of October my wife, then a very
sick woman, sent for our lawyer, Charles Alvord,
and bade him draw up a codicil revoking Chichester’s
bequest. Alvord took his notes into my library, and
without my knowledge, had Marjorie Langdon
typewrite the codicil,” Duncan drew a long slow
breath but said nothing, and the Admiral continued:
“He also had her make a carbon copy of
the codicil, thinking if the first was ruined in my
wife’s effort to sign it, he would have the other at
hand to substitute. But my wife signed the original
copy, and I instructed Marjorie to put it in my safe.
The next morning, on opening my safe, I found
the unsigned copy of the codicil, and not the signed
one.”</p>

<p>“And you believe&mdash;&mdash;?” questioned Duncan.</p>

<p>“That Marjorie Langdon deliberately destroyed
the signed codicil and placed the unsigned one in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>my safe, hoping the substitution would not be noticed
until after my wife’s death.”</p>

<p>“The last is supposition only,” commented Duncan.</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” retorted Admiral Lawrence.
“Marjorie was the only one outside our family and
the lawyer who knew of the signing of the codicil;
it was given to her to place in the safe. She only,
beside myself, knew the combination of the safe,
and Alvord, the fool, left the unsigned copy of the
codicil lying loose on my desk, ready to her hand.”</p>

<p>“And Marjorie Langdon’s motive in destroying
the signed codicil?”</p>

<p>“Her infatuation for Chichester Barnard.” The
blunt answer shook even Duncan’s iron self-control,
and he looked hastily away, lest the Admiral read
his expression. “Marjorie was the last person to
leave my library that night; I was the first to go
there the next morning, and the codicil was gone.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Duncan slowly, “you contend
that Marjorie had the motive and the opportunity
to steal that codicil,” Lawrence nodded affirmatively.
“What did she hope to accomplish?”</p>

<p>“To have Chichester Barnard inherit the hundred
thousand dollars,” the Admiral rose heavily to his
feet. “The other codicil remained unsigned, for
my wife never regained her faculties before her
death, having been first delirious and then unconscious
until death mercifully released her.”</p>

<p>“So Mr. Barnard will inherit the one hundred
thousand dollars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>The Admiral paused. “Not without a legal fight.
Get rid of Marjorie, Duncan, before the scandal
is aired.”</p>

<p>“You mean you are going to charge Miss Langdon
with the theft of the codicil?”</p>

<p>“I do. She thwarted my wife in her last conscious
act, and by God, she shall pay for it!”</p>

<p>Duncan rose to his feet. “Kindly notify me,
Admiral, of whatever steps you propose taking,” he
said, accompanying the older man to the entrance of
the club-house.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Duncan, certainly.” The Admiral
walked to the curb with him. “I realize you will
want to know in time to prevent your family from
becoming involved in the scandal.”</p>

<p>“You mistake my meaning, sir; I desire to know
what legal steps you contemplate taking, because I
propose to defend Miss Langdon in the courts.
Good evening,” and lifting his hat, Duncan turned on
his heel.</p>

<p>How far he walked or where he walked he could
never afterwards tell, but he finally became conscious
that the park policeman in Lafayette Square was
regarding him with open suspicion.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked, turning in bewilderment
to the stalwart guardian of the peace.</p>

<p>“Sure, I don’t wonder ye ask; ye’ve chased yourself
around Jackson’s statue until ye’ve given me
the blind staggers. What ails ye, sir?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Duncan pulled himself together and
finally got his bearings. “Where can I find a taxi?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“At the Shoreham, that way,” waving his arm,
and Duncan walked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>He was about to cross H Street and enter the hotel
when Small’s window display across Fifteenth Street
caught his attention, and he remembered promising
to send Janet a bunch of violets to wear to the
British Embassy. Entering the florist’s shop, he
hastily gave his directions; then paused, and selected
a beautiful corsage bouquet of single violets.</p>

<p>“I’ll take this also,” he said. “Send it to Miss
Marjorie Langdon, care of Mr. Calderon Fordyce,
same address as the other; and&mdash;eh&mdash;give me a
blank card,” discovering he had none of his visiting
cards with him. Taking the blank card which the attentive
clerk brought him, he wrote: “With best
wishes,” and signed his initials. Before placing the
card in an envelope, he studied the message and his
bold, distinctive writing in some doubt.</p>

<p>“Lord!” he muttered. “Will she take the ‘D. F.’
for Duncan Fordyce&mdash;or&mdash;damn fool.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“S</span>o</span> it’s off with the old love?”</p>

<p>“My dear Kathryn, it was never on,”
Barnard looked squarely at the pretty nurse
facing him, a faint trace of distress visible in his
polished manner. “When I called to see my aunt,
Mrs. Lawrence, I always showed you the civility and
attention which I accord to any woman; that you
chose to attach a deeper meaning&mdash;&mdash;” he shrugged
his shoulders. “I very deeply regret the&mdash;misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>Kathryn Allen’s gaze shifted from his face to the
desk, and she saw the ornaments dimly through
blinding tears.</p>

<p>“You repudiate&mdash;&mdash;?” she asked huskily.</p>

<p>“Everything you claim&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“Then your presents, your photograph....”</p>

<p>“Meant nothing,” with smiling effrontery, “except
<i>pour passer le temps</i>.”</p>

<p>In the stillness the click, click of a typewriter in
the adjoining office was distinctly audible. Barnard,
with an impatient frown at the wall dock, turned
back to the silent woman. He abhorred a scene, and
Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper had an engagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
with him shortly; it would never do for him to
find Kathryn Allen in that office. The pause lengthened,
then the woman rose shakily to her feet, and
meeting Barnard’s look of solicitude, a bitter laugh
broke from her.</p>

<p>“You have shown me a new side,” she said, controlling
herself with difficulty. “You are not usually
neglectful of your own interests, Chichester; hadn’t
you better cultivate your memory?” and before he
could answer, she slipped from the room and was
gone.</p>

<p>Reaching the sidewalk Kathryn walked aimlessly
up F Street until her wandering attention was caught
by a tall clock in front of a jeweler’s shop, whose
hands registered three o’clock, and she paused instantly.</p>

<p>“Mercy,” she muttered. “I’ve forgotten Joe!”
and turning about she made her way to Harvey’s
restaurant. Joe Calhoun-Cooper, lurking in the
doorway, watched her approach with eagerness.</p>

<p>“At last!” he exclaimed. “I thought you had forgotten
to come.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” following him to the ladies’ dining-room.
“Mrs. Wallace was not so well, and I
was detained. Nurses can’t be choosers, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give up this drudgery?” asked
Joe heatedly. “Marry me, my darling&mdash;&mdash;” sinking
his voice.</p>

<p>“Marry you?” repeated Kathryn drearily, then
her face brightened into a quick warm smile. “Well,
why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” Joe was on his feet, his eyes
alight.</p>

<p>“Sit down, you foolish boy,” and Joe, a trifle
abashed by the waiter’s stare, sank down into his
seat.</p>

<p>“What will you have, Kathryn?” he inquired, taking
up the menu card.</p>

<p>“Some hot roasted oysters and plenty of pepperine
sauce; no, no wine,” as he turned to the wine list.
“You know I don’t approve of that, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Just a cocktail,” he pleaded. “It’s bitter cold
outside.” But Kathryn shook her head.</p>

<p>“Don’t tempt me, Joe;” she settled back in her
seat and looked about the restaurant. At that hour
the room was empty and she heaved a sigh of relief;
she was not anxious to encounter any friend who
might chance to come in. She shivered slightly, half
overcome by a tormenting memory. “I will take
some coffee,” she added hastily.</p>

<p>Joe finished giving his order, and then turned his
attention fully on his companion. She looked extremely
pretty and young in her conventional tailored-suit
and stylish hat under which her red hair curled
tantalizingly. Her good looks and engaging manner
had captivated Joe when she attended him at Garfield
Hospital the year before, he having preceded
his family to Washington, and developed typhoid
fever soon after his arrival.</p>

<p>“Why did you telephone that you had to see me,
Joe?” asked Kathryn, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“It’s nearly a week since our last walk together,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>he answered moodily. “I began to think you were
avoiding me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; I told you I’ve been extra busy....”</p>

<p>“But a nurse always has her regular hours off,”
he broke in.</p>

<p>“During which I’ve been making up lost sleep,”
she retorted. “Joe, dear, don’t quarrel with me&mdash;&mdash;”
her eyes filled with tears. “I can’t bear it.”</p>

<p>“My dearest,” he patted the slender hand resting
on the table with tender fingers. “I’ll eat dirt, sooner
than make you unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Try the oysters, instead,” she advised, with a half
hysterical laugh, as the waiter placed the tempting
dishes before them. The presence of the waiter,
who stood behind Joe’s chair shucking the roasted
oysters in rapid succession, prevented further private
conversation, to Joe’s great annoyance. He wanted
Kathryn to himself, and her half-bantering, half-tender
manner but added fuel to the flame of his
passion.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here,” he suggested, rising and
pushing back his chair. While playing with her hot
coffee and oysters, of which she was usually inordinately
fond, Kathryn had done some rapid thinking,
and having decided on her course of action, she
was quite willing to leave, and in a few minutes more
they were strolling up Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>“What time do you have to return?” inquired
Joe, stopping before the Raleigh.</p>

<p>“Not until six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Joe beckoned to one of the hackmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>standing in front of the hotel, and as the brougham
drew up before them, he wrenched open the door
and before Kathryn had quite decided, she was half
pushed into the vehicle. “Go to the Mall,” shouted
Joe, springing in after her.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” she ejaculated, considerably
startled. “Joe&mdash;Joe&mdash;what’s come over you?”</p>

<p>Joe did not answer the question directly, but the
passion in his eyes brought a hot wave of color to
her cheeks; the carriage was rapidly traversing an
unfrequented street, and he was not to be denied.
His arms crept around her, and despite her vehement
protests, he rained kisses upon her lips until the fire
consuming him communicated itself to her, and she
gave back kiss for kiss with an ardor which matched
his own.</p>

<p>“Joe, you must behave!” she stammered, withdrawing
as far from him as the narrow confines of
the carriage permitted. “Suppose we are seen?
What would your family say?”</p>

<p>“They will have to know some time,” he protested.
“Beside, we are not likely to meet any of
our friends in this part of the town.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” she glanced uneasily
out of the window. “We must be getting back, Joe;
tell the driver to go up side streets until he reaches
Seventeenth and S Streets.”</p>

<p>“Will you marry me?” demanded Joe, ignoring
her request. “Will you, my darling?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you my answer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes?” eagerly, as she paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“When we reach Seventeenth and S Streets,” and
her alluring smile set his pulses racing. Opening the
door he gave his directions to the driver, then settled
back beside her.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to tantalize me?” he asked
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“It’s good for you,” shrugging her shoulders.
“You are spoiled at home. By the way, do you propose
telling your family of our engagement&mdash;providing
I accept you?” archly.</p>

<p>“In my own good time,” sulkily. “If they know
too soon....”</p>

<p>“They’ll send you away from my baleful influence.”
A mocking smile lighted her eyes and lips. Joe
winced, the remark was too near the truth to be
pleasant.</p>

<p>“It’s no thanks to your friend, Mrs. Hemmingway,
that father doesn’t know now,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” in startled surprise.</p>

<p>“I found a letter from her in father’s mail last
Monday,” he pulled out a much soiled envelope.
“Your letters used to come under cover of her address,
so I recognized her writing, and guessing
something devilish was up, hooked it before father
came home.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Kathryn slowly. “And what did my
amiable landlady say in her letter to your father?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” handing her the unopened envelope.
“I waited to give it to you to read; I would
have told you of it sooner, but you would not see
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Could not see you,” she corrected gently; then
without further words opened and read the letter.
A sharp intake of her breath attracted Joe’s attention,
and he turned from the window in time to see
her tearing the letter into infinitesimal pieces, her
face white with fury.</p>

<p>“The cat!” she exclaimed. “The vile, treacherous
cat! And after I’ve been so good to her. Thank
heaven you caught the letter, Joe; it was clever of
you, my dearest.”</p>

<p>“Luck was with me,” admitted Joe frankly,
pleased, however, at the implied compliment. “I
never trusted Mrs. Hemmingway; you remember I
warned you against her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, so you did. Oh, Joe, the things she
said about you in this letter!” opening the carriage
door and tossing out the scraps of paper. “They
make my blood boil.”</p>

<p>“My blessed darling,” as she snuggled up against
his shoulder, “if I only had enough money, I’d carry
you off tonight.”</p>

<p>“Remember I haven’t yet given you my answer,”
teasingly.</p>

<p>“I’d marry you without it,” sturdily. “Lord! if
I only had the luck of some people&mdash;Chichester
Barnard, for instance.”</p>

<p>Kathryn’s body stiffened and every drop of blood
deserted her face. “What about Chichester Barnard?”
she asked in barely more than a whisper.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you read in this morning’s paper that
Mrs. Lawrence’s will had been offered for probate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>and that she bequeathed him a hundred thousand
dollars?”</p>

<p>“I had no chance to look at the papers,” she
answered dully. Immersed in his own prospective
happiness he failed to observe the anguish which
dimmed her eyes. Suddenly she roused herself.
“So Mr. Barnard is a wealthy man; well, merit
usually wins in the end.” The covert sneer was lost
on her companion.</p>

<p>“Barnard’s a good chap,” he said tolerantly. “He
deserves his luck.”</p>

<p>“I presume now he will marry Marjorie Langdon.”</p>

<p>“Marry Marjorie Langdon?” Joe’s hearty burst
of laughter covered the quiver in Kathryn’s voice.
“Lord bless you, he’s trying for higher game.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?” the question shot from her.</p>

<p>“Janet Fordyce; and do you know,” lowering his
voice confidentially, “Christmas Eve I got rather
fuddled and was such a fool as to warn Barnard not
to marry into that family.”</p>

<p>“Were you thanked for your pains?” and the
sneer in her downcast eyes was not pleasant.</p>

<p>“Hardly; in fact, Barnard threatened to wring
my neck if I ever alluded to the Fordyce peculiarities
in public.”</p>

<p>“Tell me some other time,” she coaxed. “I think,
however, that Mr. Barnard is to be congratulated if
he marries any woman but Marjorie Langdon.”</p>

<p>“I rather like Marjorie.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” she laughed mirthlessly. “Well, I hate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>her.” There was no mistaking her envenomed tone,
and Joe’s sleepy eyes opened to twice their usual
size.</p>

<p>“Why?” in profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“Because of the humiliation I have suffered at
her hands; she never lost an opportunity ‘to put me in
my place’ when we were both at the Lawrences’, she
as secretary and I as nurse.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me; but come to think of it, Pauline
holds about the same view of Miss Langdon that
you do; thinks she’s too supercilious for a paid companion.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then your sister and I agree already.”</p>

<p>“A happy omen for the future,” exclaimed Joe,
then his face darkened. “If Marjorie Langdon has
been nasty to you, my darling, I’ll cut her acquaintance.”</p>

<p>The look she gave him was ample reward. “Ah,
Joe,” she said, a trifle sadly, “I fear your loyalty will
be taxed to the breaking point if you marry a poor,
nameless nobody like me.”</p>

<p>“Never!” he vowed with lover-like ardor. “And,
dearest, within a few years, by the terms of my
grandfather’s will, I shall inherit eight thousand a
year.”</p>

<p>“What!” Her surprise was genuine; Joe had
never before spoken of his prospective inheritance.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know about it myself until Christmas,”
went on Joe. “We can be married tomorrow if
you say so; I’ll get mother to advance me some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>money, and father will come across when he once
meets you.”</p>

<p>“And your sister?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pauline can go hang. Who cares for her
opinion?” contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I do, for one,” calmly meeting his perplexed
stare. “I most earnestly desire her friendship.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Pauline,” dryly, remembering
his treatment at his sister’s hands. “I don’t think
she will add to our joy of living.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but she may be useful to me,”
quietly. “Oh, Joe, you don’t know what it means to
a bride to sever her husband from his family. Please
God, you’ll never have that to reproach me with.”</p>

<p>“I was only thinking of you, dearest,” put in
Joe, much touched. “Between you and me, Pauline
is an awful tartar.” At that moment their carriage
turned the corner into S Street and drew up at the
curb.</p>

<p>“Your answer, dearest?” Joe’s assurance had
departed, and the hand he laid on Kathryn shook.
“Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he had to bend down to catch the whispered
word.</p>

<p>“Soon?” he urged, his voice triumphant with joy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” and the kindly darkness hid the kiss with
which they sealed their betrothal.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">K</span>athryn Allen</span> tore open the note with
impatient fingers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Darling</span>, [she read],</p>

<p>Pauline tells me Janet Fordyce and Chichester Barnard
frequently take tea at the Brown Tea Pot. I don’t know
why you asked me to find out, but, sweetheart, your word
is law to your devoted</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Joe</span>.</p>

<p>P. S. How the hours drag! I only live when with you.</p>
</div>

<p>Joe might have spared himself the postscript.
Kathryn did not even trouble to read it. Crumpling
the note into a small ball she tossed it into the scrap
basket and rising, consulted her alarm clock. The
hands on the dial pointed to a quarter past three;
she could go over to the hospital and register and
still have ample time to enjoy a cup of tea at the
Brown Tea Pot. Her valise was already packed
preparatory to leaving her present case whenever
her employer, a hypochondriac, decided she could
dispense with her services. She had gone to her immediately
after the death of Mrs. Lawrence, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>place did not suit. She did not care to nurse crotchety
patients.</p>

<p>It was a little before five o’clock when she entered
the Brown Tea Pot, and she found the cozy tea-room
partly empty. To her delight she secured a table
to herself near a large screen standing by the pantry
door, and from that vantage point she commanded
a fine view of the occupants of the room without herself
being conspicuous. She had plenty of time to
study her surroundings and admire the effect of the
softly shaded electric lights which cast a becoming,
rosy glow over the scene, before the two people
for whom she was waiting, made their appearance.</p>

<p>It was the first glimpse Kathryn had had of Janet,
and she watched her with jealous, angry eyes. She
took in the becoming, chic street costume Janet was
wearing, with grudging admiration. Chichester Barnard
always had excellent taste in women. Kathryn
had overheard Admiral Lawrence tell his wife that
their clergyman, at his request, reproved Barnard
for his fast life, and had asked him what he would
do if confronted at the Judgment Seat by the women
he had flirted with.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be ashamed of one of them,” Barnard
had retorted.</p>

<p>Janet, barely glancing about her, selected a table
across the room from where Kathryn Allen sat, and
while out of ear-shot, the pretty nurse could observe
them without appearing to do so. By the time
Barnard had finished giving his order to their waitress,
the people sitting nearest them had completed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>their tea and departed. Janet bit her lip with vexation;
she had chosen that particular table because it
had near neighbors, and above all things she
wished to avoid anything like a private <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with Barnard. Usually the Brown Tea Pot was
crowded, and conversation had to be of the most
trivial and impersonal character on account of the
danger of being overheard. She had accepted
Barnard’s invitation to have tea with him against
her better judgment.</p>

<p>Barnard made no secret of his satisfaction at their
isolated position. He never troubled to turn and
glance about the room, and Kathryn Allen’s presence
went unnoticed.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you would rather have hot chocolate
than tea, Janet?” he inquired, with gentle
solicitude.</p>

<p>“Quite sure. Mother says too much tea drinking
is responsible for my nervous irritability.”</p>

<p>“Your mother is too harsh a critic,” he commented.
“I detect no irritability on your part, only&mdash;&mdash;”
he paused thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes?” she prompted, looking away from him.</p>

<p>“An adorable reserve,” ardently. “Why do you
not let me see more of you?”</p>

<p>“I have already explained the reason, Chichester.”</p>

<p>“Your social duties?” He shrugged his shoulders
disdainfully. “Bah! why consider such empty
trifles.”</p>

<p>“They are not trifles, but a treadmill,” she retorted
warmly. “But, Chichester, I don’t believe mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>and Marjorie would approve of my meeting you so
often alone, and I hate to do anything underhand.”</p>

<p>“You are the soul of honor.” His look caressed
her, and she shivered involuntarily. “Then why not
let me call every day at your house?”</p>

<p>“Duncan doesn’t like you,” she admitted faintly.
“And he has prejudiced mother&mdash;&mdash;” in her desire
to avoid Barnard’s glance, she missed seeing the
tawney gleam which for a second marred the beauty
of his heavily lashed dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I can guess the reason for your brother’s dislike,”
he admitted grimly. “Perhaps I can remove the
cause. His interest in Miss Langdon appears
mutual. Hadn’t you better warn your mother to
watch those two?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” She raised startled eyes
to his.</p>

<p>“How would you like Miss Langdon as a sister-in-law?”</p>

<p>Janet sat in dumfounded silence. Even the arrival
of their waitress with the chocolate pot, whipped
cream, and hot toasted English muffins did not arouse
her. Had Barnard supplied her with the key to
Duncan’s altered demeanor and Marjorie’s shy, distraite
manner? Would her mother accept Marjorie
as a daughter-in-law without opposition? Duncan
was her idol, and Janet knew she had always planned
a most ambitious future for him.</p>

<p>“Then the idea doesn’t appeal to you?” questioned
Barnard as the waitress retired. “Well, don’t
worry; Marjorie has other suitors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“I am given to understand that you are one of
them.”</p>

<p>“By some kind friend, I suppose?” But Barnard’s
laugh was not as sincere and hearty as he tried to
make it. “Did Pauline Calhoun-Cooper also mention
that Tom Nichols is one of Marjorie’s suitors?”
The spoon Janet held rattled against the side of her
cup. “Ah, I thought not,” added Barnard, smiling
quietly to himself. “Did the gallant captain never
confide to you his admiration for his beautiful
cousin?”</p>

<p>But Janet was game, notwithstanding her secret
anguish. Barnard had indeed opened her eyes, but
not in the way he had intended. Quickly she rallied
her wits to her aid; she must not let her keen-eyed
companion realize the new influence which was
dominating her. Ah, love was two-edged; too late,
she had divined the gold from the dross.</p>

<p>“Captain Nichols has made no secret of his affection
for Marjorie,” she retorted coolly. “Why
do you seek to prejudice me against him?”</p>

<p>“Because I do not approve of your friendship.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; it’s purely platonic.”</p>

<p>“There is no such thing between a man and a
maid.” Barnard’s tone stirred Janet’s hot anger, but
she controlled herself admirably. “You show your
youth by advocating such views.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to be insulting?”</p>

<p>“Put such an idea instantly out of your mind.”
There was stern command in his eyes and voice, and
Janet shrank back, frightened by the storm she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>provoked. “I should never think of insulting you,
I love you too deeply,” his tones vibrated with feeling.
“I respect you too highly&mdash;but I am jealous,
bitterly jealous. I, and I alone, must rule your
heart and mind. ‘Thou shalt have no other god
but me’!”</p>

<p>“Don’t blaspheme!” She cringed back in her
chair, and covered her ears with her shaking fingers.
“Chichester, Chichester, I have given you no cause
for jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not intentionally,” he admitted, more
quietly. “But for my comfort, you see too much
of Tom Nichols.”</p>

<p>“You are entirely mistaken. I haven’t seen him
for some time.”</p>

<p>“How about your motor ride with him on Christmas
Day?” She colored in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“How did you hear of it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“News travels fast when a man boasts....”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” she broke in vehemently. “Tom
Nichols isn’t that sort. He would keep his word to
me to say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then your intimacy has reached the stage of
mutual secrets!” Barnard’s brow darkened. “Now,
once for all this <i>platonic friendship</i>,” with biting
sarcasm, “must stop. As your fiancé, I forbid you to
have anything further to do with him.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I refuse?” Janet drew her furs
about her, and flung back her head defiantly. Her
blood was up.</p>

<p>“You will do nothing so foolish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“I shall, too.” Janet’s eyes blazed back into his.
“And I want you to understand that our engagement
is broken.”</p>

<p>Barnard’s smile was his only answer as he contemplated
her, and despite the warmth of the room
and her furs, Janet felt a chill strike to her heart,
and the pupils of her eyes distended with fear as
Barnard bent toward her across the table.</p>

<p>“Pauline Calhoun-Cooper has missed her bracelet,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p>Janet crimsoned; then turned deathly pale. Fearing
she would faint, Barnard raised his tea-spoon
and struck his empty goblet until the glass vibrated
loudly. While waiting for the waitress, he again
addressed his silent companion.</p>

<p>“Do you still wish our engagement broken?”</p>

<p>“No,” faintly.</p>

<p>“You will drop Tom Nichols?” Getting no answer,
he repeated his question with more insistence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she promised; but the monosyllable was
even fainter and more reluctant than the first.</p>

<p>“Good!” Barnard smiled sunnily upon her; his
anger and jealousy a thing of the past. “I know you
will keep faith with me, my darling,” then he added
in a different tone, as their waitress appeared.
“Will you please bring us some more ice water.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;must go,” Janet clutched her bag and
gloves in desperate haste. She felt that she should
scream if she remained in the room a moment longer.
She was shivering from head to foot.</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s still early,” remonstrated Barnard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>“You haven’t finished your muffin.” But Janet
shook her head.</p>

<p>“I must go,” she reiterated; and Barnard, a past-master
in knowing when to concede a point, rose to
his feet. As they made their way to the door, they
passed Judge and Mrs. Walbridge, and the latter
stopped them.</p>

<p>“I never saw two people so interested in each
other,” she declared breezily; then added with elephantine
playfulness, “Of course, Mr. Barnard was
only telling you, Miss Fordyce, about his law cases.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Barnard, the twinkle in
his eyes belying his serious expression. “I was just
mentioning to Miss Fordyce that crime knows no
sex.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Kathryn Allen, back in her far
corner of the room, paid for her tea and scones and
went hurriedly out of the shop. She had never taken
her eyes from the two people she had gone there to
watch, and bitterly she regretted that she was not a
lip-reader. One thought was uppermost in her mind.
What hold had Chichester Barnard over Janet
Fordyce?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">R</span>epresentative J. Calhoun-Cooper</span> laid
down his pen and regarded his wife in some surprise.
“Are you going to church, Augusta?”</p>

<p>“No, I attended the morning services.” She ensconced
herself in a chair near him. “Pauline told
me that you wish to see me.”</p>

<p>“Quite right; but I had no idea you were going
out,” Calhoun-Cooper hesitated. “However, I will
not keep you long. Can you tell me who are Joe’s
associates in Washington?”</p>

<p>His wife stirred uneasily. “Do you mean men
or girls?”</p>

<p>“Both.”</p>

<p>“Pauline’s friends and mine are his associates,”
with an abruptness equal to his own.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure, Augusta?” She changed
color under the peculiar emphasis of his voice.</p>

<p>“Quite; Joe has been most exemplary in his behavior,”
she saw a further question trembling on his
lips and forestalled it. “You are never fair to Joe;
you take everyone’s word against his. Joe has the
making of a splendid man if you didn’t hector him
so continuously. Give the boy a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“I have spent years doing it,” Calhoun-Cooper
sighed. “Unfortunately Augusta, what you term a
‘chance’ and I term an ‘opportunity’ are not synonymous.”</p>

<p>“Your ‘opportunity’ spells work, I presume,” and
his wife frowned. “You never recollect Joe’s delicate
lungs.”</p>

<p>“Delicate fiddlesticks!” interrupted her exasperated
husband. “Too much smoking....”</p>

<p>“There you go again,” the ready tears filled Mrs.
Calhoun-Cooper’s eyes. “Believing tales because
you want to....”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be fairer in your treatment of
Joe,” protested his wife. “Joe takes after my
family, and instead of inheriting your robust health,
has our constitutional delicacy.”</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper glanced with some grimness
mixed with amusement, at his wife’s large frame and
substantial weight. “Too bad the tendency in your
family, when it skipped your generation, didn’t crop
out in Pauline,” he commented slowly. “I would
like a detailed answer to my question, Augusta. Who
are Joe’s particular associates?”</p>

<p>“Let me see; Duncan Fordyce and his sister, the
Warren girls, Jimmie Painter, and Carroll Logan”&mdash;she
paused reflectively.</p>

<p>“Ever hear of a Miss Kathryn Allen?” asked her
husband.</p>

<p>“Kathryn Allen? Wasn’t she Joe’s nurse at Garfield....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“So I have heard,” dryly. “I am told the friendship
between them has&mdash;increased.”</p>

<p>“Is Pauline your informant?” demanded his wife,
but he pretended not to hear, and she continued hurriedly,
“Whatever you hear in that quarter is exaggerated
nonsense. Far from spending his time
with women, Joe is usually with Chichester Barnard
and his other men friends.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Captain Nichols here lately,”
Calhoun-Cooper tore a fragment of a letter into
long pieces and tossed them into the scrap basket.
“Do you know why he has stopped coming to see
us?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea,” answered his wife
candidly. “Unless Pauline has&mdash;has not encouraged
his attentions.”</p>

<p>“I did not know&mdash;&mdash;” he broke off abruptly.
“Tell me, Augusta, have you been supplying Joe
with money lately?”</p>

<p>“I? Oh, dear no,” but her eyes fell before his,
and his face grew graver. “What made you think
such a thing?”</p>

<p>“It has happened before,” dryly. “I shall be exceedingly
displeased if you are giving Joe money.
I cut down his allowance with very good reason.”</p>

<p>“I believe you actually begrudge Joe money,” she
put in passionately. “For shame, as wealthy as you
are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not a matter of wealth, but of principle,”
sternly. “Under the plea of his supposed constitutional
lung weakness you have over-indulged Joe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>It’s greatly my fault,” as his wife’s sobs increased.
“I gave too much time to my business and trusted to
incompetent tutors. Joe has two more years to toe
the mark, and in that time his character must be
formed, otherwise he will go to the bad utterly. I
hope you have never disobeyed my injunction against
informing him of his prospective inheritance by the
terms of my father’s will?”</p>

<p>“Do you take me for a fool?” she asked sharply,
and changed the subject. “I must say, John, your
father was very remiss not to leave a like amount
to Pauline, she bitterly resents Joe’s getting all that
money.”</p>

<p>“So you have told Pauline?” Her husband’s eyes
kindled in wrath. “Well, upon my word! Will
you never learn discretion?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper promptly took refuge behind
more tears, a bulwark which usually never
failed her; but her husband was too indignant to
pay heed to her emotion, and continued sternly: “I
trust you informed Pauline that I would amply
provide for her?” renewed sobbing was his only reply.
“I have told you before, Augusta, that I do
not approve of the partiality you show Joe; it is
most unfair to Pauline, and causes constant dissension
and unhappiness. It must stop.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I grant Pauline’s every wish,” exclaimed
his wife, much aggrieved. “She has her own way,
and plenty of clothes, jewels&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Speaking of jewels,” broke in Calhoun-Cooper.
“What has become of the emerald and diamond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>bracelet, which formerly belonged to my mother, the
one I gave Pauline on her coming out? I haven’t
seen her wear it lately?”</p>

<p>His wife gulped back a sob, and wiped her eyes
with a damp handkerchief. She also had missed the
bracelet, and she had last seen it in Joe’s hand,
Pauline having carelessly left it on her mother’s
dressing table the night of their large dinner dance.
Joe had admitted its beauty just before he went
downstairs to assist his sister in welcoming their
guests.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;it’s at Galt’s being mended,” she stuttered;
giving her husband the same excuse for its disappearance
which she had made to Pauline. “I discovered
some of the stones were loose.”</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper contemplated her rapidly crimsoning
face with misgiving. “Did you take the
bracelet to Galt’s?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’ll stop in and get it tomorrow,”
she rose precipitously. “How time flies! It’s after
three; I have barely time to get to the informal
musicale Mrs. Fordyce is giving at four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Do you and Pauline see much of Marjorie
Langdon?”</p>

<p>“Not more than we can help,” snapped his wife,
her temper getting the upper hand. “Neither
Pauline nor I trust her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Trust her? Exactly what do you mean by that
term?”</p>

<p>Startled by the curtness of his tone, Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
stopped on her way to the door. “We feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>that Marjorie Langdon is jealous of Pauline’s friendship
with Janet Fordyce, and is prejudicing her
against us. I’ll tell you more about our suspicion
later, John; I must hurry now. Oh, dear, I don’t
believe I’m presentable!” getting a glimpse of her
tear-stained face in the mirror, and turning she hastened
from the room.</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper remained for some time at his
desk; then, after consulting the telephone book, he
rose, and giving a few directions to the butler, left
the house and made his way to Madame Yvonett’s
residence.</p>

<p>Earlier in the afternoon Tom Nichols had left
Fort Myer intending to call on Janet. Since his
interview with Duncan two days before, he had
received no message from Janet. In very desperation
he had placed the bracelet in a box containing
a bunch of violets and left it with the Fordyce butler
the previous afternoon. Perkins had solemnly
promised to give the box to Janet on her return, and
with a lighter heart, Tom had returned to Fort
Myer, fully expecting that Janet would call him up
on the telephone. But she never did so. While
deeply wounded by her silence, his longing to see
her had finally conquered, and he motored to Washington
that Sunday afternoon intent on demanding
an explanation.</p>

<p>On approaching the Fordyce residence he noticed
a number of motors and carriages driving up to the
door, and thinking some entertainment was going on,
he promptly turned his car about and made for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>cousin’s house in Thirteenth Street. Madame
Yvonett would probably be able to give him news of
Janet. On his arrival, to his great disgust, he found
the Quakeress with a room full of callers, and it was
fully an hour before they departed and he had her
to himself.</p>

<p>“Draw up thy chair, Thomas,” directed Madame
Yvonett. “Where has thee been keeping thyself
since Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Mostly at Myer. I’ve called you up on the telephone,
Cousin Yvonett, several times to ask how
you were.”</p>

<p>“So Rebekah has told me, and I appreciate the
trouble thee has taken. Will thee let me refill thy
cup?”</p>

<p>“No more, thank you,” setting down his empty
teacup. “How is Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“Very busy just now; thee sees the season is in
full swing, and she has little opportunity to come in,
but I talk with her every day on the telephone.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Janet Fordyce recently,” with
elaborate carelessness, helping himself to a pretzel.</p>

<p>“She was here but yesterday, and inquired particularly&mdash;&mdash;”
Madame Yvonett stopped speaking as
Minerva pulled back the hall portière and Representative
J. Calhoun-Cooper walked into the room.</p>

<p>“I fear you do not recall me, Madame Yvonett,”
he said, as the Quakeress rose. “I am John Cooper,
and I had the pleasure of calling upon you and your
husband with my father years ago in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Thee does my memory an injustice, Friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>Cooper,” exclaimed Madame Yvonett cordially. “I
have a very agreeable recollection of thy father and
thyself. But I admit thee has changed somewhat
in appearance since those days. Does thee know my
cousin, Thomas Nichols?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the Captain and I are old acquaintances,”
shaking hands with Tom as he spoke. “What has
become of you lately? My wife and Pauline tell me
you have not been near them.”</p>

<p>“My duties at Myer have increased recently;
courts-martial, and all that,” answered Tom, slightly
embarrassed by the direct question. He had heard
nothing further of his lost coin, and more than ever
convinced that Joe had stolen it, he had kept away
from the Calhoun-Coopers, disliking to accept their
hospitality under the circumstances. “I hope your
wife and daughter are both well,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>“Very well, thanks.” Calhoun-Cooper sat down
near Madame Yvonett, and declining the cup of tea
offered him, began speaking of Paris, and the
Quakeress, enchanted at the allusion to the city and
life she had loved so well, recounted amusing experiences
of her sojourn in the French capital.</p>

<p>Tom took but little part in the conversation, and
fidgeted uneasily. He was determined to find out
from Madame Yvonett all that she could tell him
about Janet, and waited with increasing impatience
for Calhoun-Cooper to take his departure. But he
found out-sitting the Representative a harder tax on
his nervous system than he had bargained for.</p>

<p>“Thee brings back happy memories,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>Madame Yvonett, with a half-sigh. “Must thee
go?” as Calhoun-Cooper stood up, “I have enjoyed
thy visit, friend; and if thee has an idle hour thee
must come again.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Calhoun-Cooper, shaking hands
warmly; then turning to the expectant Tom, he
asked; “Walk uptown with me, Nichols, I am anxious
to have a word with you.”</p>

<p>Tom’s face fell, and he was about to explain that
he was obliged to return almost immediately to Fort
Myer when Madame Yvonett answered for him.</p>

<p>“Go with Friend Cooper, Thomas,” she said, “and
return and have supper with me.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cousin Yvonett, I will. I only hesitated,
sir,” addressing Calhoun-Cooper, “because I am not
walking; but I’ll be very happy to take you home in
my car.”</p>

<p>It was the Representative’s turn to hesitate. “Suppose
you leave me at the club instead,” he said
finally. “Good night, Madame Yvonett.”</p>

<p>“Good night, friend,” the Quakeress accompanied
the two men to her front door. “Do not forget thee
must come again soon.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” and raising his hat, Calhoun-Cooper
stepped into the motor. He watched
Madame Yvonett until she closed the door. “A
gentlewoman of the old school, Nichols,” he commented
softly. “Cultured, brilliant, kindly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She is that and then some,” exclaimed Tom enthusiastically.
“Cousin Yvonett is a brick.”</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper smiled. “Hardly the expression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>I should have selected, but perhaps it covers my
meaning.” He said no more until the car drew up
before his club. “Come in with me, Nichols, I am
anxious to have an uninterrupted talk with you. I
will detain you but a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Barely waiting for Tom’s assent, he strode into
the club and led the way to a small unoccupied room
and carefully closed the door. Tom took the chair
pushed toward him, and waited with some uneasiness
for his companion to explain why he wished to see
him. He wondered if Calhoun-Cooper had heard
of some of Joe’s Washington escapades, and if he
was to be catechised on the subject.</p>

<p>“Miss Marjorie Langdon is your cousin, is she
not?” asked Calhoun-Cooper, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“Yes; my second cousin, to be exact.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where she procured the emerald
and diamond bracelet which she pledged with the
Justice of the Peace at Hyattsville...?”</p>

<p>“Can I what?” exclaimed Tom, in profound astonishment.</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper repeated the question.</p>

<p>“May I ask what earthly business it is of yours?”
demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“The bracelet happens to belong to my daughter,
Pauline,” was the calm reply.</p>

<p>Hardly able to believe his ears, Tom sat back in
his chair and glared at Calhoun-Cooper.</p>

<p>“I was motoring down from Baltimore Christmas
afternoon, and was arrested for speeding just
after your release,” continued the Representative,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>receiving no response from his dumfounded companion.
“While paying my fine I saw and recognized
Pauline’s bracelet lying on the desk before the Justice
of the Peace. He informed me it had been left
there by Miss Marjorie Langdon.” Tom’s convulsive
start was not lost on Calhoun-Cooper. “Will
you kindly tell me how your cousin obtained possession
of my daughter’s bracelet?”</p>

<p>Tom stared stupidly at his questioner. “You’re
cra&mdash;crazy,” he stuttered. “My cou&mdash;cousin left
her&mdash;left her own bracelet with the Justice.”</p>

<p>“She did no such thing,” shortly. “I examined the
bracelet carefully; it belonged to my mother before
I gave it to my daughter, and her initials, my father’s,
and the date of the wedding are engraved on the
inside of the bracelet. There was no possibility of my
being mistaken. Did you redeem the bracelet?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it?” holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“I can’t; I’ve returned it....”</p>

<p>“In that case,” slowly, “suppose we ask Miss
Langdon for it.”</p>

<p>Tom squirmed in his seat. Ask Marjorie? Then
indeed the fat would be in the fire, and his promise
to Janet to keep her presence at Hyattsville a profound
secret would be broken. Marjorie would undoubtedly
declare she had not been with him at
Hyattsville.</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken about the bracelet, sir,”
he protested vehemently. “Call up and ask your
daughter if she hasn’t her own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“I asked her this morning, and she informed me
it was not in her possession.”</p>

<p>Tom turned white. What the devil was the man
driving at? It <i>must</i> be Janet’s bracelet; she would
have been wearing none but her own that afternoon.
A wealthy girl did not deck herself out in other
people’s jewelry.</p>

<p>“I intended seeing you before this, Nichols,” continued
Calhoun-Cooper, after an appreciable pause.
“But I have been exceedingly busy for the past four
days, and have had no opportunity to take up the
matter of the bracelet until today. I not only prize
the piece of jewelry for its association and money
value, but I am determined to find out <i>how</i> that
bracelet got out of my daughter’s possession.”</p>

<p>“What did your bracelet look like?”</p>

<p>Quickly Calhoun-Cooper told him, and Tom’s
heart sank; it was an accurate description of the one
Janet had pledged with the Justice and he had later
redeemed.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize it?” demanded the Representative,
and Tom nodded a reluctant assent.</p>

<p>“They sound the same,” he acknowledged cautiously.
“But stranger coincidences have been
known. Perhaps your daughter was also motoring
on the Bladensburg Pike that afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” retorted Calhoun-Cooper
roughly. “That bracelet was stolen....”</p>

<p>“D&mdash;mn you!” Tom sprang for the other’s throat.</p>

<p>“Take your hands off me!” thundered Calhoun-Cooper,
struggling to free himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll make you eat those words first,” and Tom’s
grasp tightened.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say your cousin stole the bracelet,” panted
the other. “Have a little sense.”</p>

<p>Slowly Tom released him, and the Representative
straightened his rumpled collar and tie.</p>

<p>“Suppose you explain exactly what you are driving
at,” said Tom, resuming his seat.</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper did not reply at once. “I
went to Madame Yvonett’s intending to question
her....”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” broke in Tom.</p>

<p>“But on seeing that dear old Quakeress I couldn’t
do it,” admitted Calhoun-Cooper. “I’m a great believer
in caste, Nichols; no niece of Madame
Yvonett’s will go wrong. Ask Marjorie Langdon
to tell you the truth about that bracelet, and I will
believe every word she says.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” mumbled Tom, at a loss for a longer
answer.</p>

<p>“I will let you speak to Miss Langdon; she’ll
probably confide the whole matter to you,” added
Calhoun-Cooper, rising, and Tom followed his example.
“But remember, if I don’t get that bracelet
back in two days with an adequate explanation, I’ll
go to Miss Langdon myself, and if necessary&mdash;to
the police.”</p>

<p>“That threat is not necessary,” exclaimed Tom,
his anger rising. “And speaking of making criminal
investigations, sir; hadn’t you better watch a member
of your own family?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper recoiled, and before he could
recover from the emotion that mastered him, Tom
was out of the club and into his roadster. As the
car shot away into the darkness, Tom laid his head
wearily on the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“In God’s name,” he mumbled, “how can I question
the girl I adore as to how a piece of jewelry
came into her possession?”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Fordyce</span> awoke from her nap to discover
Janet earnestly regarding her from
the depths of a big tufted arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Bless me, Cutie!” she ejaculated. “Have I been
asleep?”</p>

<p>“You certainly have,” admitted Janet laughing.
It was not often her mother called her by
the familiar, schoolgirl nickname. “And snoring,
too.”</p>

<p>“Janet!”</p>

<p>“Well, just a little snore,” hastily, noting her
mother’s offended expression. “I wouldn’t have disturbed
you, mumsie, dear, if I hadn’t thought Marjorie
was here with you. I am sorry my entrance
awoke you.”</p>

<p>“I have no business to be sleeping at this hour.”
Mrs. Fordyce shook herself more fully awake and
glanced at the clock. “Are you not lunching with the
Thayers today?”</p>

<p>“Not going there until Saturday,” shortly. “Thank
goodness I’m having a little rest today.”</p>

<p>“Are you tired, dear?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” reluctantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Then perhaps you had better give up going to
the dance tonight&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Miss the Charity Ball? Well, I guess not.
Why, mumsie, they say that’s the greatest fun ever.”</p>

<p>“I was only thinking of your health; you and Marjorie
have both gone out rather strenuously this past
week, and Marjorie is showing the strain also.”</p>

<p>“Then let her stay at home,” calmly. “I’m quite
capable of taking care of myself; and, mumsie, people
are laughing at me for being tied to Marjorie’s
apron-strings.”</p>

<p>“What people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some of the girls,” vaguely. “When you
come down to it, mumsie, it is rather annoying to
have to ask advice and instruction from a girl only
a few years older than I.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fordyce looked troubled. “Has Marjorie
been officious in any way?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no,” reflectively. “But going to Marjorie
for advice and seeing her presiding in your place
isn’t agreeable to me. I miss you, mumsie, dear.”</p>

<p>“My baby girl!” Mrs. Fordyce crossed the room
and gave her daughter a loving kiss and hug. “And
I miss you; but, dearest, it is impossible for me to
take part in the gay world, and I made this arrangement
with Marjorie as the best way to further your
interests and pleasure. Duncan tells me she is extremely
popular and....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Duncan!” Janet shrugged her shoulders
disdainfully. “Duncan will tell you anything to
keep Marjorie here&mdash;he’s crazy about her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“What!” Mrs. Fordyce dropped back in her
chair and gazed with astonished eyes at Janet.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you noticed his infatuation?”</p>

<p>“Noticed it? Of course I haven’t,” with some
sternness. “What meddlesome Mattie has been hinting
such a thing?”</p>

<p>“My two eyes,” tartly. “Hadn’t you better be
using yours, mumsie?”</p>

<p>“That will do; I will not permit impertinence.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will leave me under Marjorie’s influence....”</p>

<p>“I have yet to see one act or word on Marjorie
Langdon’s part which you might not copy with impunity,”
declared Mrs. Fordyce with decision. “And
I have been thrown with her even more than you.
No, it is someone else who is responsible for your
sudden&mdash;flippancy,” hesitating for a word. A knock
sounded on the boudoir door, and she called out:
“Come in. Well, Perkins, what it is?” as the butler
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Miss Calhoun-Cooper wishes to see Miss Janet
a moment,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Sit still, Janet,” directed Mrs. Fordyce, as her
daughter made a motion to rise. “Ask Miss Calhoun-Cooper
to come up here, Perkins.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t like Pauline?” said Janet in
surprise, as the butler retreated down the hall to the
elevator.</p>

<p>“You have just convinced me that I am leaving
you too much with others, Janet,” dryly. “Hereafter
I shall take pains to see more of your friends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>Good morning,” as Pauline entered the room. “You
are very good to come upstairs.”</p>

<p>“The idea of putting it that way, dear Mrs. Fordyce.”
Pauline shook hands effusively with her, and
kissed Janet warmly. “Please don’t let me disturb
you; I only stopped to ask if Janet would care to go
with me to see Kellar, the magician, on Friday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” exclaimed Janet, heartily.
“Thanks so much; I dote on Kellar.”</p>

<p>“Then you have seen him before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a number of years ago. He’s sure to have
some new tricks by this time; I had no idea he was
coming to Washington.”</p>

<p>“Kellar is only giving this one matinée performance.
Do you think your brother would care to go?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he would; I’ll ask him,” rising hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Duncan is out just now,” put in Mrs. Fordyce.
“He telephoned he would lunch at the club.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know as soon as he comes in,”
promised Janet, dropping down on the sofa beside
Pauline.</p>

<p>“You are very good to invite my girl and boy,”
said Mrs. Fordyce. “I thank you for giving them so
much pleasure.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mine,” insisted Pauline, lending
undue emphasis to the hackneyed phrase. “I regret
I was only able to get four seats together, Janet, and
therefore cannot ask Miss Langdon to accompany
us. Captain Nichols has already promised to make
the fourth in our small party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“We have not seen much of Captain Nichols
lately,” commented Mrs. Fordyce.</p>

<p>“Nor we,” answered Pauline. “I met him just
as I was leaving the theater this morning, and asked
him then and there, to my relief, for it is almost impossible
to get him on the telephone. He tells me
his quarters are not connected with the post ’phone,
and he has to go to the officers’ club to get and send
messages.”</p>

<p>“What keeps him so busy?” Janet examined Pauline’s
jewel-studded gold mesh bag with open admiration.</p>

<p>“When I taxed him with not calling, he said his
official duties had kept him tied to Fort Myer. That
excuse covers his not visiting us”&mdash;with an affected
laugh, “but of course, there’s another reason for his
not calling here....”</p>

<p>“And pray, what is that?” demanded Mrs. Fordyce,
eyeing her daughter’s flushed countenance intently.</p>

<p>“A lover’s quarrel with&mdash;Marjorie Langdon.”
Pauline pronounced the name with much impressiveness.
If she heard Janet’s sudden, sharply drawn
breath, she gave no sign.</p>

<p>“Captain Nichols and Marjorie!” exclaimed Mrs.
Fordyce in bewilderment. “You surprise me. I
never knew he was attentive to <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“I suppose his relationship covers his attentions
to the casual observer,” went on Pauline thoughtfully.
“How nearly related are they?”</p>

<p>“I believe he is Marjorie’s second cousin,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Janet in a voice she strove to make indifferent.</p>

<p>“So there’s no bar to their marriage; except I
believe, Miss Langdon does not fancy love in a
cottage.”</p>

<p>“You do Marjorie an injustice,” announced Mrs.
Fordyce quietly. “If her affections were really engaged,
I don’t think she would hesitate to make any
sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“I hope your good opinion of her is justified.”
Pauline flushed at the rebuke, which Mrs. Fordyce’s
manner more than her words, conveyed. “Miss
Langdon has gained a reputation for mercenary
selfishness.”</p>

<p>“Poverty is apt to teach one the value of money,”
replied Mrs. Fordyce. “Still, that is different from
being staring and stark mad; and I for one shall
give Marjorie the benefit of the doubt. Every cent
of money she has, she lavishes on her aunt, Madame
Yvonett; that does not look to me like ‘mercenary
selfishness.’”</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon is fortunate to have you for a
friend,” Pauline rose. “And I am afraid she needs
them, poor girl; people are not always prepossessed
in her favor.” Her voice expressed deep commiseration,
and Mrs. Fordyce felt inclined to box her ears.
Accustomed to being accorded every deference by
her family, and protected by her seclusion from
contact with the free and easy manner of the
younger generation to their elders, she deeply resented
Pauline’s flouting address and flippant style.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>Pauline, busy adjusting her furs, missed the disapproving
look cast in her direction, and turning
to Janet, asked: “Will I see you at the ball
tonight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we expect to go.” Some of the enthusiasm
of the morning had gone from the fresh young voice,
and again Mrs. Fordyce covertly studied her
daughter. What had come over Janet?</p>

<p>“Your box is next ours,” continued Pauline, lingering
near the sofa. “Mrs. Walbridge is on our other
side. Mother always insists on finding out who our
neighbors will be before purchasing tickets for charitable
entertainments.”</p>

<p>“As a health precaution?” inquired Mrs. Fordyce.
“Or is it a question of social prestige?”</p>

<p>“Both,” acknowledged Pauline quickly. “So
many things are catching these days, we don’t like
to come in contact with&mdash;dirt.” And her meaning
smile deepened as she saw Mrs. Fordyce flinch; she
had scored at last. “We all have our idiosyncrasies,
dear Mrs. Fordyce; good-bye. Don’t trouble to
come downstairs with me, Janet, I can find my way
out alone.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m coming with you.” Janet followed
her friend out of the room, leaving her mother sitting
in her chair in a brown study. She was aroused
almost immediately by Janet’s re-entrance.</p>

<p>“What an odious creature!” she shivered. “Upon
my word, Janet, what’s the world coming to? Are
there no ladies any more?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t be old-fashioned,” Janet threw herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
down pettishly on the sofa. “Can you give me
some money, mumsie?”</p>

<p>“What has become of your father’s Christmas
check?”</p>

<p>“Spent,” laconically. “I can’t help it, mumsie;
money just evaporates in this old town. I just want
to buy a&mdash;a&mdash;new bracelet,” glancing down deprecatingly
at her bare wrist.</p>

<p>“You have a careless hand, Janet,” said her
mother reprovingly. “However, I cannot have you
want for anything. Will a check for fifty dollars
do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; thank you, darling,” beaming gratefully
upon her mother. “But instead of a check, could
you give me&mdash;&mdash;” she stopped as some one rapped
on the door. In response to Mrs. Fordyce’s bidding,
Marjorie stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“Am I late?” she asked, laying a bundle of papers
on the table beside Mrs. Fordyce.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minutes ahead of luncheon,” answered
Janet shortly.</p>

<p>“What have you here, Marjorie?” Mrs. Fordyce
put her hand on the papers.</p>

<p>“Receipted bills,” Marjorie drew up her chair
and sorted the papers carefully.</p>

<p>“The butcher, the baker, and the candlestick
maker,” quoted Mrs. Fordyce, busily inspecting Marjorie.
She saw her through new eyes, the eyes of a
mother judging a possible daughter-in-law. Suddenly,
she pressed her fingers against her eyes; the
lids were wet with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“If I were you, I would stop dealing with Jackson,”
announced Marjorie, finding the particular bill she
was searching for. “He calmly sent in an unitemized
account, calling for seventy-five dollars, and
when I insisted on going over his books, we found
he had overcharged you eighteen dollars. I gave
him the check Mr. Fordyce had made out for the
larger sum on condition that he refund me the
eighteen dollars. Here it is,” tumbling the money
out on the table.</p>

<p>“You won’t be popular with the cook, Marjorie,
if you have interfered with her rake-off,” snapped
Janet. “What’s a few dollars to father?”</p>

<p>“Janet!” Mrs. Fordyce spoke in a tone that Marjorie
had never heard before, and her daughter on
but one other occasion. “You forget yourself
strangely this morning; apologize at once to Marjorie
for your unnecessary remark.”</p>

<p>“I meant no offense to Marjorie,” protested
Janet. “I merely intended to say it was silly of her
to interfere after things have been bought and paid
for.”</p>

<p>“Your explanation strikes me as being worse than
the offense,” Mrs. Fordyce was thoroughly aroused,
and not heeding Marjorie’s attempt to restore peace,
added, “I am grateful to Marjorie for saving me
from a swindler; apparently you think because the
amount is small that I should submit to being robbed.
Let me tell you, Janet, that no one is so rich that
he can stand being fleeced, and any woman who
knowingly permits graft in her kitchen is worse than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>a fool. Never let me hear you again advocate condoning
knavery.”</p>

<p>Janet bowed before the storm. “I won’t, mother,”
meekly. “Indeed, Marjorie, I did not mean to insult
you in any way.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you didn’t,” answered Marjorie, more
puzzled than hurt by Janet’s peculiar manner; they
had been from their first meeting sworn allies and
good comrades. “Please think no more about it,
dear.”</p>

<p>“What dirty money!” Mrs. Fordyce withdrew
her hand from the table hastily. “Do take it away.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” laughed Janet, recovering somewhat
her usually sunny disposition, and she was about
to gather up the soiled bank notes when her mother
stopped her.</p>

<p>“No, you must not touch them,” she declared, and
Marjorie opened her eyes at her vehemence. “I
will have Calderon send them to the Treasury to be
redeemed.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, ma’am,” said Perkins from behind
the half-open door. “Captain Nichols is at the
telephone and wishes to speak to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Me, Perkins?” and Janet sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Janet, he asked for Miss Langdon.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take the message for me, Janet?”
inquired Marjorie, laying a paper-weight over the
receipted bills.</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” and Janet disappeared from
the room.</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to her whims,” advised Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>Fordyce kindly. “I’ll go over the accounts with you
later; don’t keep Captain Nichols waiting.”</p>

<p>Marjorie found Tom exceedingly curt on the telephone,
and she hung up the receiver a few seconds
later, wondering what under the sun induced everyone
to become so ill-tempered all of a sudden. As
she walked through the dining-room after leaving the
pantry, where she had gone to answer the telephone
in preference to disturbing Mr. Calderon Fordyce in
his library, she encountered Janet pouring out a
glass of ice water.</p>

<p>“What did your cousin want?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He said he would be unable to dine here tonight....”</p>

<p>“Does he think we run a hotel,” Janet was pale
with anger, “that he breaks our invitations at will?
How dare he treat us so cavalierly!”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Marjorie’s authoritative voice, though
low-pitched, brought the furious girl to her senses.
“Captain Nichols intends no disrespect to your family
or to you; in fact, he highly appreciates your
kindness and hospitality.”</p>

<p>“Then why doesn’t he come here?”</p>

<p>“He told me to tell you that he had received
an invitation to dine at the White House, and therefore
had to cancel his engagement here, to his
great regret. He will join us later at the Charity
Ball.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Janet’s face altered. “I understand now,
please say nothing....”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” and Marjorie, seeing that Janet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>obviously desired to be alone, made her way thoughtfully
to her room.</p>

<p>Once there she lost no time in getting out her
calling costume preparatory to a hurried toilet after
luncheon. On reaching up for her hat which she
kept on the top shelf in her closet, she knocked down
a cherished florist’s box and out tumbled a withered
bunch of violets. With an exclamation of annoyance,
she stooped to pick up the petals and dried
leaves, and her fingers closed over cold metal. Considerably
startled, Marjorie retreated to the window
and examined what she held in her hand. It was a
beautiful emerald and diamond bracelet which was
carefully secured about the short stems of the
bouquet.</p>

<p>Marjorie gazed at it in complete bewilderment;
then going over to the closet, she picked up the box
and its cover. It bore the florist’s name from whom
Duncan had sent her a corsage bouquet some days
before; but certainly when she wore the violets and
afterward put them away for safe keeping no bracelet
had encircled the stems.</p>

<p>More and more startled Marjorie returned to
the window, and inspected the bracelet with minute
care. The unique design seemed oddly familiar.
With great difficulty she finally deciphered the initials
on the inside: “S. P.”&mdash;“J. C. C.”&mdash;“Jan. 14, 1844.”</p>

<p>“‘S. P.&mdash;J. C. C.’” she repeated thoughtfully.
“J. C. C.&mdash;where have I heard&mdash;Heavens! J. Calhoun-Cooper&mdash;of
course, I’ve seen Pauline wear the
bracelet. How did it get here?” She looked at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>beautiful bauble with increasing horror, as her ever-present
fear supplied an answer to her question.</p>

<p>“God help Janet if Pauline ever finds out who took
her bracelet,” she groaned. “She will meet no mercy
there.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>om Nichols</span> passed down the long line of
the receiving party at the Charity Ball and
paused near the north end of the New Willard
ballroom and looked about him. The floor was
thronged with dancers, and from where he stood it
was impossible to make out the occupants of the
boxes which lined the length of the room on both
sides. He waited for some minutes, hoping that at
the end of the dance he would be able to walk about
the floor, but the music was continuous, the Marine
Band breaking into a fox trot when the Engineer
Band at the opposite end of the room, ceased playing.
He shouldered his way through the waiting
men, and dodging between the dancers, he walked
down the room as best he could, and reaching the
center spied Marjorie and Janet sitting in their box
with several friends. In a few seconds he joined
them.</p>

<p>“Better late than never, Tom,” exclaimed Marjorie
gaily. “You’re a sight for sair e’en. Janet
dear, here is Captain Nichols.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how are you,” Janet paused long enough in
her conversation with Baron von Valkenberg to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>Tom’s hand, then deliberately turned her back on
him.</p>

<p>Tom’s lips were compressed in a hard line as he
bowed to Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper, who was occupying
an adjoining seat in the next box, and leaning
across the brass railing which divided them, he conversed
for a short time with her. A movement in
his own box caused him to turn back, and he discovered
Janet on the point of leaving. He stepped
in front of her deliberately.</p>

<p>“My dance, Miss Janet,” he announced. A quick
denial sprang to her lips, only to be checked by the
quiet confidence of his manner. Tom encountered
von Valkenberg’s astonished stare over her shoulder,
and addressed him directly. “Sorry, Baron, to disappoint
you, but Miss Janet promised me this dance
some time ago; come,” and with care he assisted
Janet down the few steps leading to the floor.</p>

<p>So congested was the dancing that after circling
the room once Tom stopped his partner near
the entrance to the small ballroom and led her
inside it.</p>

<p>“Suppose we sit over there,” he said pointing to
some chairs at the farther corner of the room.
“There is no pleasure in dancing with such a mob on
the floor.”</p>

<p>“It’s much cooler here,” volunteered Janet, a few
minutes later, breaking a pause which threatened to
become awkward.</p>

<p>“Yes,” absently.</p>

<p>Janet glanced askance at Tom. She had longed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>to see him, and now that he was by her side, she was
tongue-tied. She knew that every instant spent in
Tom’s society would arouse Barnard’s jealous rage,
but forbidden fruit was sweet.</p>

<p>“Why did you boast of our motor trip to Hyattsville?”
she blurted out.</p>

<p>“I, boast of it? I never mentioned it to a soul!”
If she had exploded a firecracker before Tom, he
could not have been more astounded. “I swear I
never told anyone,” he added, with vigor, and her
aching heart was comforted.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” she answered, with such trust
kindling her shy regard that Tom hitched his chair
closer to her side.</p>

<p>“Did you really think I had betrayed your precious
confidence in me?” Janet shook her head.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, just couldn’t, believe it,” she admitted.</p>

<p>“You darling!” Tom’s hand sought hers. “Who
dared to say I boasted of such a thing?”</p>

<p>“As long as you didn’t do it, the rest doesn’t
matter,” declared Janet, with true feminine logic,
and changed the subject abruptly. “Was it fun at
the White House?”</p>

<p>“I’d have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t wanted to
be elsewhere,” admitted Tom truthfully. “An invitation
to the White House is final&mdash;to an army or
navy officer; I couldn’t decline it, no previous engagement
plea goes. I hope you understand....”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” Janet was nervously playing with her
fan. “But there have been other times when you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>might have co&mdash;when the White House wouldn’t
have interfered with your coming to&mdash;to&mdash;see me.”</p>

<p>“Only your wish kept me away.”</p>

<p>“My wish?” Startled, Janet faced toward him.</p>

<p>“Certainly; how else was I to construe your
silence?”</p>

<p>“My silence!” indignantly. “Did you want me
to cry from the house-tops that I wished to see you?”</p>

<p>“Such an extreme measure was not necessary,”
retorted Tom stiffly. “An answer to my message
would have been sufficient.”</p>

<p>“I never received any message from you.”</p>

<p>“What! Why, I told your brother to ask you to
telephone when I could call and see you?”</p>

<p>“He never told me&mdash;only mentioned you were to
dine with us tonight&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s the limit!” Tom banged his sword-hilt
with his fist. “Not getting any reply from you I
jumped to the conclusion you were tired of seeing
me.”</p>

<p>“For a soldier you’re mighty easily discouraged,”
taunted Janet, her spirits rising as the misgivings
and doubts of the past few days gave way before
Tom’s explanations.</p>

<p>“Never again,” vowed Tom. “Next time I’ll
storm the citadel. But joking aside,” dropping his
bantering tone. “I did try to see you; called
several times, telephoned&mdash;but you were always out.
I finally decided it was intentional; thought you
wanted to drop me.”</p>

<p>“How could you be so unjust!” Janet’s reproachful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
look caused Tom’s heart to beat more rapidly
under his blue uniform. “I am always loyal to my
friends. You won’t back out of dining with us tomorrow
night?”</p>

<p>“What a way to put it?” Tom made a slight
grimace. “Of course, I’m coming, and I’ll count the
hours until then.”</p>

<p>“The day after Christmas I waited in for you the
whole afternoon and evening, and you never came,”
continued Janet plaintively.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get away from Myer that afternoon,
and had to wait until Friday before going to Hyattsville
to redeem your bracelet. By the way that bracelet
is very beautiful,” lowering his voice. “The
emeralds and diamonds are exceptionally fine, and
the workmanship exquisite.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad your taste coincides with mine,”
said Janet, with a quick coquettish glance upward.
“I couldn’t bear to lose the bracelet; it is so unique.”</p>

<p>Tom stroked his chin thoughtfully. “Have you
ever seen another bracelet like it?” he questioned at
length. A keen glance accompanied the words, but
Janet was watching the distant dancers, and her expression
conveyed nothing to him.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no, I don’t believe I have,” she replied
slowly, and Tom’s heart sank. “It’s unusual appearance
is one of its beauties to me. Have you my
bracelet with you?”</p>

<p>“Have I?” in profound astonishment. “No,”
then seeing her disappointed look, he asked sharply,
“Why should you expect me to have your bracelet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Who else would have it?” her eyes opening
wider. “Didn’t you redeem it for me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did, but I left it at your house on
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Left it at my house?” she half rose, then sank
back again in her chair. “I have never received it.”</p>

<p>“What! Didn’t you find it in the box of violets?”</p>

<p>“Violets? I never received any violets from you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t?” Tom’s bewilderment was so pronounced
that Janet took fright.</p>

<p>“D&mdash;do you think the florist stole the bracelet?”
she demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No, he couldn’t have. I bought the violets at
Small’s, took them with me in my motor, and on a side
street opened the box and slipped the bracelet over
the stems, where you couldn’t fail to see it. I left
the box at your house myself.”</p>

<p>Janet looked at him queerly. “Ah, indeed; and
with which member of the household did you leave
it?”</p>

<p>“I gave it to Perkins, and he promised to deliver it
to you immediately on your return.”</p>

<p>“He never gave it to me.”</p>

<p>Tom rose. “I’ll go straight up to your house and
ask him for it.”</p>

<p>“No, no.” She laid a restraining hand on his sword-hilt.
“He is probably in bed by now; mother’s
so thoughtful for her servants, she lets them
retire early when I’m out with Duncan; he always
has his latchkey. I’ll ask Perkins first thing in
the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“And will you let me know the results?” Tom
resumed his seat. “I shall be on tenter-hooks until
I know the bracelet is safely in your hands. I feel
responsible, you know; if it’s lost....”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” noting his worried air. “Bracelets
have disappeared before; don’t take it to heart.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me which jewelry shop it came from&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>It was some moments before she replied. “It was
an antique.”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart grew heavy again. At every question
he ran into a blank wall. How was he ever to disprove
Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper’s absurd
statement unless he had something tangible to work
on. The bracelet was surely bewitched by some evil
genius.</p>

<p>“An antique? That’s hard luck,” he answered
finally. “If it is really lost through my carelessness
in trusting a servant, I shall want to replace it....”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think of such a thing,” vehemently.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I insist. You draw the design and I’ll
have it made.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think of letting you go to all that
expense,” protested Janet.</p>

<p>“To think I made you lose an ornament you
value!” groaned Tom. “I, who would move heaven
and earth to spare you the slightest....” but
Janet never waited for him to complete the sentence;
she had caught sight of Chichester Barnard standing
in the doorway talking to Mrs. Walbridge. His
back was turned to them; it was just possible that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>had not seen that she was with Tom. She sprang
to her feet.</p>

<p>“Do forgive me,” she whispered hurriedly. “Marjorie
has just waved to me; I must go. Please don’t
follow me.” And before the startled officer could
even get to his feet she had darted across the floor
and out of the room, and brought up breathless
beside Mrs. Walbridge.</p>

<p>“No sign of late hours in these rosy cheeks,” commented
the latter, touching Janet’s scarlet face
with her gloved finger. “She needs no beauty
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no,” agreed Barnard. “But I’m going
to be selfish enough to ask Miss Janet to sit out a
dance with me,” laying his hand with an air of possession
on her arm which enlightened sentimental
Mrs. Walbridge.</p>

<p>“Run along,” she directed, interrupting Janet’s
hasty protests. “I was young once myself. Don’t
bother to wait for me. My husband will get me
some fruit punch.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly Janet walked toward her box, Barnard
in close attendance. In her desire not to have him
see her with Tom, she had given him an opening for
a quiet chat with her alone&mdash;unless Marjorie was
in their box. But Marjorie, attended by Baron von
Valkenberg, had gone “visiting” in a neighboring
box, and Duncan was dancing with Pauline Calhoun-Cooper.
Janet prayed that Barnard was in a
pleasant mood; she had grown to dread his uncertain
temper. He could be so charming when he wanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>to. Her heart was fluttering like a caged bird as she
preceded Barnard into the empty box; she dared not
offend him, and she dreaded more scenes.</p>

<p>“I hear congratulations are in order,” she began.</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“On your inheritance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” Barnard spoke as if it were a mere
bagatelle. “I may be a long time getting it; settling
an estate is tedious work. Aunt Margaret was angelic
to remember me in her will, and I am doubly
grateful, because, when I receive the inheritance I
can lavish it all on you, my darling,” bending toward
her, but a loud burst of laughter from the Calhoun-Cooper
box caused him to look in that direction.
Janet moved her chair imperceptibly nearer the brass
railing and away from his side.</p>

<p>“On second’s thought I don’t believe I’ll let you
spend any of your inheritance on me,” she remarked
thoughtfully, as he turned back to her. The pupils
of his eyes contracted, and Janet was conscious of
a feeling akin to repulsion.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m not good enough for you, Chichester,” she
stammered. “You should marry a woman of brilliant
mental attainments&mdash;a woman of the world&mdash;I’m
only an unformed schoolgirl.”</p>

<p>“You have too modest an opinion of yourself,”
he protested with passionate ardor. “It’s your freshness,
your originality which I adore. My bonnie
lassie and her susceptible heart!” His voice and
eyes caressed her, and a warmer color suffused her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>cheeks. “I’m not half good enough for you, but
such as I am, I am your slave always.”</p>

<p>“Always!” she echoed, and Barnard leaned forward
to look more closely at her, but she avoided
his direct gaze, and concentrated her attention on the
dancers on the floor beneath them.</p>

<p>All Washington apparently was present to aid the
pet charity for which the ball was annually given,
and men and women in every condition of life were
enjoying the entertainment. High government officials,
diplomats, leaders of the ultra-smart set, and
members of the resident circle vied with each other
to make the ball a success. Janet scanned the opposite
boxes in which sat beautifully gowned women,
whose superb jewels glittered in the rays of the
hundreds of electric lights.</p>

<p>“My darling!” She jumped nervously, and held
up a protesting hand.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she cautioned. “Don’t forget Mrs. J.
Calhoun-Cooper is sitting near us, and she may overhear....”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she go away,” muttered Barnard
disgustedly. “Lately, I seldom have you to myself.
If I was of a suspicious nature, I might think it was
intentional”&mdash;Janet squirmed in her chair, and after
contemplating her a moment in smiling satisfaction,
Barnard again inspected Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper.
“She looks like an Indian begum.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so unkind in your criticism,” with an
effort Janet summoned a careless smile. “Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s
gown is a creation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Hum! the modiste has left most of the surface
to be covered by jewels&mdash;cold comfort tonight.
Don’t you want your scarf over your shoulders?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I am still warm from dancing.”
Janet’s eyes again sought the throng below her.
“I wonder where Marjorie is&mdash;and Duncan. Oh,
look, who is the pretty woman dancing with Joe
Calhoun-Cooper?”</p>

<p>Barnard glanced in the direction she indicated,
and his eyebrows rose suggestively. “No one you
are likely to know, lady bird. How fearfully they
dance.”</p>

<p>“She is graceful,” declared Janet. “But Joe&mdash;nothing
could make him so.”</p>

<p>“Women take to the new-fangled dances better
than the men,” grumbled Barnard. “Give me the
old-fashioned waltz and two-step every time. Even
the music has deteriorated; no melody any more.
Listen to that,” as the Marine Band burst into a
popular tune, “nothing to be heard but the big drum,
it drowns every other instrument&mdash;hark!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to hear it,” she objected. “Let
us talk instead.”</p>

<p>“That is just what we can’t do&mdash;the big drum
sounds distinct and clear; listen&mdash;!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“Barnard again inspected Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper. ‘She looks
like an Indian begum.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper’s ever busy eyes had also
noted the pretty woman with whom Joe was dancing,
and a displeased frown marked her forehead. She
was about to send one of her guests after Joe with
a message that she desired his presence, when she
observed Marjorie Langdon approaching. Joe and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>his pretty partner stopped dancing near the latter,
and Marjorie, recognizing Kathryn Allen, stepped
forward and held out her hand, but no sign of recognition
lighted the nurse’s face, and after inspecting
Marjorie with marked insolence she cut her dead.
Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper, an interested spectator of
the little drama, thrilled with satisfaction as she
caught the hot resentment that flamed in Marjorie’s
face. Controlling herself, Marjorie stepped back
out of the crowd and came face to face with Duncan
Fordyce.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where you’ve been keeping yourself,”
he said, “but I searched both ballrooms and
haven’t found a sign of you until now.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been dancing,” she sighed rather
wearily. “Mrs. Burns asked me to sit in her box for
a while; I am on my way back to Janet now to arrange
about going down to supper.”</p>

<p>“Let us have one dance first,” pleaded Duncan,
and taking silence for consent, he slipped his arm
about her waist and they threaded a way through the
other dancers.</p>

<p>Pushing unpleasant thoughts to one side, Marjorie
surrendered herself wholly to the pleasure of the
moment. The pressure of Duncan’s strong arm gave
her a sense of protection which soothed her jagged
nerves unutterably, and she danced almost without
being conscious of the people around her. Duncan’s
gaze sought her face so persistently that they had
several narrow escapes from bad collisions. They
were turning a corner near the entrance to the small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>ballroom when they caromed violently into a man
who was striving to make his way down the room,
and shot him against the side of one of the boxes.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” apologized Duncan and
Marjorie in concert, and the stranger, recovering his
equilibrium, stared fixedly at Duncan.</p>

<p>“Nice way to treat old friends,” he began, but
got no further.</p>

<p>“Paul Potter! by all that’s glorious!” shouted
Duncan, seizing his hand and wringing it hard.
“Where did you drop from?”</p>

<p>“New York, stopping with Judge and Mrs. Walbridge.
I tried to telephone you”&mdash;&mdash;he stopped
out of breath.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon, let me present Dr. Paul Potter, of
San Francisco,” broke in Duncan, and Marjorie
found herself looking into the most piercing eyes
she had ever seen in human head, as her hand was
taken in a firm clasp.</p>

<p>“Very glad to meet you, Miss Langdon,” said the
physician cordially. “I’m sorry to have interrupted
your dance.”</p>

<p>“We were on the point of stopping&mdash;&mdash;” she
began.</p>

<p>“Not so that I could notice it,” and Dr. Potter’s
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we were exceeding the speed limit,”
acknowledged Duncan. “Come over to our box,
Paul, and sit with us.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, old man, I must be getting back to Mrs.
Walbridge; she is anxious to go down to supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps we can get a table together. Come on,
I’ll ask Mrs. Walbridge, her box is near ours.”</p>

<p>Marjorie accompanied the two men to the steps
leading to the boxes, but on approaching the one
occupied by Mrs. Walbridge she turned and addressed
Duncan.</p>

<p>“I won’t wait for you,” she said, “but will join
Janet at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll be along in a minute,” and Marjorie
hastened down the narrow aisle alone.</p>

<p>Janet and Chichester Barnard were still sitting
as close as the chairs permitted in the corner of the
box, their heads almost touching as they whispered
together, and Marjorie’s eyes narrowed as she took
in the tableau. She had watched Janet dancing with
Tom with a contented mind, and the last she had
seen of Barnard he was dancing attendance on Mrs.
Walbridge.</p>

<p>“Well, good people, thinking of supper?” she inquired,
and noticed with an odd sensation Janet’s
flushed face and embarrassed manner as she turned
to meet her.</p>

<p>“Our thoughts are not so material,” protested
Barnard easily.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no?” and the faint irony of her tone was not
lost on Barnard’s keen susceptibilities.</p>

<p>“Who was the little man walking down the room
with you and Duncan, Marjorie?” questioned Janet
hurriedly. “His face looked familiar.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Potter, of San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Of course; how stupid of me not to recognize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>him, he once attended mother,” in a hurried aside
as her brother and Tom entered the box.</p>

<p>“Going down to supper?” asked Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper,
attracted by her neighbors’ preparations
for leaving.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Marjorie shortly.</p>

<p>“Then suppose we join forces,” ignoring the
lack of cordiality in Marjorie’s manner. “Kindly
hand me my scarf.” Her overbearing tone
brought the carmine to Marjorie’s cheeks, and
a hot retort was on her lips when, thinking better
of it, she mastered her indignation. Stooping
she picked up the gold and silver Coronation scarf
which had fallen inside their box, and laid it
across Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s bare expanse of
shoulder.</p>

<p>“All ready?” questioned Duncan, inspecting his
small party. “Then come on.”</p>

<p>Once in the crowded dining-room on the ground
floor of the New Willard, Marjorie thanked a
kindly Providence which ordained that the tables
were too small to accommodate the Calhoun-Cooper
party and her own, and she saw them depart
to another quarter of the room with inward joy.
Barnard, silently resenting that he was the fifth spoke
in the wheel, left them, and joined another group of
friends, and Duncan, contemplating his sister and
Tom already deep in conversation, gave his undivided
attention to Marjorie. They were none of them
conscious of the tardiness of the service, or the
flight of time, and Tom gave voice to genuine regret
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>as they finally rose from the table and made their
way to the lift.</p>

<p>“Why do good times have to end?” he grumbled.
“I don’t know when I have enjoyed myself so
much.”</p>

<p>“It has been fun,” agreed Janet softly, secretly
longing to linger beside the distinguished-looking
young officer. “Shall we see you at dinner tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” he whispered, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Janet,” Duncan’s strong arm propelled
his sister forward. “Don’t you see the lift
is waiting?”</p>

<p>As Marjorie and Tom started to follow them some
new arrivals pushed rudely between, and an instant
later, the packed elevator shot upward.</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll catch the next one,” said Tom
consolingly, as he darted to the second shaft. “It’s
coming down now.” They waited impatiently for
the passengers in the elevator to step out in the
square hall, then entered and found they had the
lift to themselves. The elevator boy was about to
release the lever, when the starter tapped on the
glass partition, and throwing open the door, permitted
Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper to step
inside.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir,” said Marjorie cordially.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do,” replied Calhoun-Cooper,
somewhat taken aback on recognizing his companions.
He barely nodded to Tom, whose greeting
was equally curt; and Marjorie, becoming aware of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>the apparently strained relations between the two
men, broke the awkward silence.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are too late to see the ball at
its height,” she said.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get here any earlier,” answered Calhoun-Cooper.
“Have you seen my wife and daughter
this evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they finished supper before we did, and
have already gone back to the ballroom.”</p>

<p>Calhoun-Cooper, who had been watching Marjorie
with peculiar intentness, wheeled on Tom.</p>

<p>“My congratulations, Captain,” he said sardonically.
“You executed my commission with commendable
quickness.”</p>

<p>“I don’t catch your meaning, sir,” retorted Tom
frigidly.</p>

<p>“The bracelet was returned to me this evening.
My thanks to you&mdash;both,” and bowing he
turned to the door as the boy brought the lift to
a stop.</p>

<p>Under the shock of his words Tom and Marjorie
stood stock still, eying one another in complete bewilderment,
while one question raced through the
brains of both: what did the other know of the lost
bracelet?</p>

<p>“All out,” exclaimed the elevator boy insistently,
as he rolled back the door, and Marjorie, recovering
herself first, followed Calhoun-Cooper into the reception
hall out of which opened the large ballroom
and cloak-rooms.</p>

<p>Just as Calhoun-Cooper started for the ballroom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>Pauline crossed the threshold, and seeing her father,
stopped short.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” she exclaimed, making no effort to
lower her penetrating voice. “Mother’s pearl necklace
has been stolen from her.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arjorie</span> handed the menu back to the
chef, gave him the completed marketing
list, added a few instructions, and made
her way to the boudoir. There was no buoyancy in
her step, and she looked wretchedly ill as she crossed
the threshold into the sunlit room. If Mrs. Fordyce
had not been deeply immersed in her own condition,
she could hardly have failed to observe the deep
circles under Marjorie’s eyes, and the hectic flush in
each white cheek. Her sleepless night had left its
telltale mark.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, Mrs. Fordyce?” asked
Marjorie, walking over to the couch on which the
older woman was lying propped up with pillows.</p>

<p>“Better, thank you; if this old heart of mine only
stops palpitating I will be up and about again in no
time. Sit down by me, dear,” and Marjorie took a
chair by the couch.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I had better call off the dinner
tonight?” she said.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” with emphasis. “These heart attacks
are not serious.” Marjorie, perceiving the
blueness of her lips and her gray pallor, thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>differently, and her heart ached for her gentle benefactress.
She longed to take Mrs. Fordyce into her
confidence, to tell her all her doubts and fears; but
how could she tell the story of the thefts implicating
Janet to the mother who adored her? “Janet has
set her heart on having this dinner, and I cannot disappoint
the child,” went on Mrs. Fordyce.</p>

<p>“But I don’t think Janet will enjoy entertaining
while you are ill,” said Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Tut! Just an indisposition; don’t alarm the
child,” sharply.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think of doing it,” protested Marjorie.
“I only feared the sound of the guests’ voices might
disturb you.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; this house is soundproof,” smiled
Mrs. Fordyce. “There was a time when I reveled
in dinners and dances; now I have to take my fun by
proxy&mdash;don’t begrudge me the crumbs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Fordyce!” Marjorie’s shocked voice
brought another smile to her companion’s lips.</p>

<p>“There, there, dearie,” she patted Marjorie’s
hand affectionately. “Don’t worry about a worn-out
shell. Calderon has sent for a trained nurse; not
that I need one, but the idea seemed to give him
some comfort.”</p>

<p>“And of course you agreed.”</p>

<p>“Naturally; when you are married, my dear, you
will soon discover that matrimony is made up of
mutual concessions; that is, if you wish to stay married
to the same man. Tell me, is there any truth in
the report of your engagement....” Marjorie’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>fingers tightened on the hand she was holding, then
slowly loosened.... “to Captain Nichols?”</p>

<p>“Tom!” Her surprise was so pronounced that
Mrs. Fordyce smiled to herself. “Why, he’s just
like an elder brother.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you are heart-whole and fancy free?”
But Marjorie treated the sentence as a remark and
not as a question, and Mrs. Fordyce continued pleasantly.
“Enough of intimate affairs today. Will you
go through the morning mail and use your judgment
about the answers to the invitations?”</p>

<p>Marjorie picked up the pile of letters on the table
and rose.</p>

<p>“Are you&mdash;&mdash;?” she stumbled in her speech, and
Mrs. Fordyce eyed her in some surprise. “Are you
quite satisfied with me?” and under her lingerie
waist her heart pounded painfully as she awaited
Mrs. Fordyce’s answer which was somewhat long in
coming.</p>

<p>“Absolutely satisfied,” acknowledged Mrs. Fordyce,
and the smile accompanying the words almost
broke down Marjorie’s composure. Stooping, she
kissed her warmly, and when she looked up some
of the brightness had returned to her face. “I have
absolute confidence in you,” added Mrs. Fordyce
quietly. “Run along now, dear, and come back when
you have finished answering the letters.”</p>

<p>Lighter at heart Marjorie hastened to the library,
but on opening the door, she discovered Mr. Calderon
Fordyce busy at his desk, and without disturbing
him, she slipped back into the hall and sought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>the drawing-room. Going over to the boule cabinet,
which she on several occasions had used in an emergency,
she proceeded to open and sort Mrs. Fordyce’s
correspondence, frequently making entries and
looking up dates in an engagement book which she
had brought with her. The last letter was in a
handwriting which she recognized, and wondering
why Mrs. Arnold should send a second invitation
to the same person in the same mail, she tore open
the envelope.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Fordyce</span>, [she read],</p>

<p>I am just sending a formal invitation to your daughter to
our dinner dance at the Country Club, and I do hope that she
can come. I will see that Miss Fordyce is properly chaperoned.
Miss Langdon’s presence will not be necessary....</p>
</div>

<p>Marjorie dropped the letter and stared vacantly
before her. Five days previously Mrs. Arnold had
gushingly invited her to the dinner dance, telling her
that a written invitation would be sent to her shortly,
and begging her not to forget the engagement. What
did the sudden change of front portend? “Miss
Langdon”&mdash;heretofore Mrs. Arnold, a leader in
the young married set, had always addressed her as
“Marjorie.”</p>

<p>Putting the letter back in its envelope, Marjorie
commenced an answer to a luncheon invitation, and
completing it, hurriedly folded the notepaper, only
to discover that the back sheet was partially written
on. With an exclamation of annoyance, she caught
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>it up and ran her eyes over the clear back-hand, her
mind subconsciously taking in the meaning of the
written words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Captain Nichols</span>:</p>

<p>I am sending this by special delivery, as I want you to
get it without fail [heavily underscored]. Perkins tells me
he had to go out and gave your violets to Annie, the chamber
maid. Annie says she placed the box in the dressing-room as
it was cooler there and she thought the flowers would keep
better. She knows nothing more of the matter, did not tell
me of the flowers because she thought they would be found
by me or Marjorie Langdon....</p>
</div>

<p>A bad blot finished the sentence, and explained
why the sheet had been discarded.</p>

<p>Marjorie sat stunned, too confused, at first to puzzle
out the significance of the unfinished note, which
was in Janet’s unmistakable handwriting. Then she
rose, stumbled over to the broad sofa, and curling up
in one corner, pillowed her head on her arms, and
gave herself up to elucidating the enigma;&mdash;but the
more she thought the more nonplussed she became.</p>

<p>Janet’s note indicated that Tom Nichols had sent
her violets which apparently she had never received;
she hinted that Marjorie might have found them&mdash;but
the only violets which she, Marjorie had received
had come from Janet’s brother, Duncan, the afternoon
of the British Embassy dinner. Touched by
the attention, and stirred by a deeper emotion than
she had ever felt before, she had carefully preserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>Duncan’s withered bouquet in her closet. Astounded
by the discovery of the emerald and diamond bracelet
in her flower box; utterly unable to explain how it
got there, she had, in her desire to protect Janet and
silence any investigation which the loss of the bracelet
might start, returned it anonymously to Representative
J. Calhoun-Cooper. In the light of Janet’s
note, had she inadvertently, not looking at the contents
of Small’s box, put away in her closet Janet’s
violets, and the maid, finding only Duncan’s withered
bouquet in the dressing-room, thrown it away? It
seemed the only explanation. But Representative
J. Calhoun-Cooper’s remarks in the lift at the ball
indicated that he was aware the bracelet had come
from her, Marjorie, and that <i>Tom knew of its loss</i>.
Could it be that Tom had discovered that Janet was
a kleptomaniac?</p>

<p>The mere idea brought Marjorie up all standing;
only to sink back again with a groan, appalled
at the possibility. Honest Tom, with his high standards
of rectitude, in love with a girl whose perception
of the laws governing <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> was so
blunted, spelled tragedy. Marjorie dismissed the
thought with a shudder, and her mind reverted to
another puzzling phase of the situation: Calhoun-Cooper,
by speech, and Tom, by look, had implied
she was responsible for the loss and return of the
bracelet. Who had....</p>

<p>“For once I’ve caught you napping!” teased a
voice, and Marjorie jerked herself erect, to find
Chichester Barnard standing looking down at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The laughter in his eyes gave way to concern at
sight of her face. “My darling, what is it?” he
questioned, alarmed.</p>

<p>“Nothing”&mdash;then seeing his disbelief, she added,
“Nothing that would interest you....”</p>

<p>“But everything that concerns you, interests me,”
he protested. “What is troubling you?”</p>

<p>“A matter of no moment,” speaking more briskly.
“What brought you here this morning?”</p>

<p>“To be quite frank I called to see Janet Fordyce,”
he replied brusquely, nettled by her manner.</p>

<p>“I prefer you when you are candid....”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to pick a quarrel with me?”</p>

<p>“Is that so difficult a thing to do?” insolently.</p>

<p>“If you mean I swallow every&mdash;&mdash;” Barnard
stopped, controlling his aroused anger with difficulty.
“Come, come,” he said more mildly. “It is a waste
of time for us to bandy words.” He held out his
hands with the charming smile which had won many
a friend for him. “Let’s kiss and&mdash;forget.”</p>

<p>Marjorie made no move to take his extended hand.
“Who let you in?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The footman.” Barnard paced rapidly up and
down before the chimney-piece, then seated himself
by Marjorie’s side. “Don’t treat me as an outsider,”
he pleaded. “I have always your best interests at
heart; let me share your worries as well as your
pleasures. I’ll do anything in the world for you,
Madge, anything”&mdash;and his voice shook with the
strength of his passion.</p>

<p>Marjorie hesitated; her distrust controlling her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>impulse to confide her perplexities to the man who,
only six short weeks before, had absorbed her mind
and, as she thought, her heart.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” she began formally. The
conventional words somewhat chilled Barnard’s
ardor, but his offended expression went unnoticed as
Marjorie again hesitated. “What did Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
say to you about the loss of her necklace?”
she asked finally.</p>

<p>Barnard smiled wryly. “It would be easier to tell
you what she left unsaid&mdash;she only exhausted her
vocabulary as we reached her house, and even then
Pauline had to caution her to be quiet before the
servants.”</p>

<p>“An impossible woman!”</p>

<p>“With a still more impossible family,” impatiently.
“Did you notice Joe’s manner to his
mother when she called him into her box at the ball
last night?”</p>

<p>“No; but did you see who was with him?”</p>

<p>“Did I,” with eloquent emphasis. “Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
apparently took stock of Kathryn
Allen, to her disadvantage. She was not asked to
enter their box.”</p>

<p>“The Calhoun-Coopers have social aspirations,
don’t forget that....”</p>

<p>“They won’t let us forget it,” shrugging his
shoulders, “but I rather like Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper.”</p>

<p>“I did, until last night”&mdash;the bitterness in her
voice caught Barnard’s attention, but before he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>question her, she rose and stepping over to the desk,
picked up Janet’s unfinished letter to Tom Nichols
and deliberately tore it into tiny pieces. “If you will
excuse me, I’ll find out what is keeping Janet,” and
gathering up Mrs. Fordyce’s letters and engagement
book she made for the door, where she paused.
“Have you any idea what steps Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
intends taking to recover her pearl necklace?”</p>

<p>“Telegraphed for Pinkerton’s men I believe;
Madge, don’t go....” but she glided from the
room before he could stop her, and with a muttered
exclamation he reseated himself. A few minutes
later the footman appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon wishes me to tell you, sir, that
Miss Janet is out motoring with her brother,” he announced.</p>

<p>Barnard, who had started up at the servant’s
entrance, coolly resumed his seat. “I will wait until
Miss Janet returns,” he said.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” and Henderson retired.</p>

<p>Barnard was about at the end of his patience when
Janet entered the room.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to be late,” she apologized hurriedly.
“Duncan’s new motor-car just came this morning,
and he asked me to go for a run in it. I expected to
be back before you got here,” tossing off her furs and
coat as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” and with quick, deft fingers
Barnard assisted her to remove her heavy veil.
“What a becoming hat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think so?” dimpling with pleasure.
“Marjorie selected it; she has awfully good taste.
Has she been here?” in some anxiety.</p>

<p>“I came to see you, lady bird, and not to talk about
another girl,” Barnard glanced hastily about the
room. “Come over and sit in that bow window, and
nobody will disturb us.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” and crossing the room, Janet settled
herself in an arm-chair. She was sick of fighting
against the inevitable, and such Chichester Barnard
now appeared to her. Try as she did, she could not
avoid him. His omnipresence tormented her. She
had gone out with Duncan purposely, hoping to miss
his visit. On learning that he was awaiting her
return, she had sent in hot haste for Marjorie only
to be told that her chaperon had stepped out on an
errand for her mother. She had stood outside the
drawing-room portières for fully three minutes before
finding courage to enter. If only Barnard would
not make love to her!</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a wee bit sleepy after last night?” she
asked as he joined her in the bow window.</p>

<p>“The prospect of seeing you this morning has kept
me wide awake,” tenderly. “You treated me shamefully
at the ball, giving so many dances to other men.”</p>

<p>“You deserted me at supper,” in quick defence.
“We only stayed a little longer after that; Marjorie
developed one of her headaches&mdash;my goodness”&mdash;catching
sight of a limousine turning into the driveway
leading to their porte-cochère. “Who’s calling
here at this hour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“I believe it’s the Calhoun-Coopers,” Barnard
peered cautiously out of the window. “It looks like
their car. The theft of their pearls has murdered
sleep.” He stepped back and scanned Janet mockingly.
“Will you face the music?”</p>

<p>She put out her hand as if to ward off a blow,
and rising hurriedly, darted out into the hall and
stopped the footman on his way to the front door.</p>

<p>“Not at home, Henderson,” she directed. “And
Mrs. Fordyce is not feeling well enough to see anyone.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Miss Janet.”</p>

<p>Janet turned with lagging footsteps back to the
drawing-room, one hand pressed to her side to still
the pounding of her heart. Barnard, a look of deep
concern on his handsome face, met her at the threshold.</p>

<p>“My precious darling!” he murmured, but with
trembling hands she pushed him violently from her
as he attempted to kiss her.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she implored, and staggered over to
the grand piano.</p>

<p>“How long must I serve!” demanded Barnard,
his voice shaking with emotion as he followed her.
“Janet, will you never listen to the dictates of your
heart?”</p>

<p>“If I did&mdash;&mdash;!” Janet’s agonized gaze left his
face and traveled downward to the keyboard of the
piano. Suppose she told him too much? She must
keep a guard upon her tongue&mdash;</p>

<p>“Play for me, Chichester,” she pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Barnard, no mean musician, struck several chords
and stopped. “I am afraid the piano wants tuning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the man must have left without finishing his
work,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Probably went to get his lunch; here are his
tuning-fork and kit.” Barnard picked up the instruments.
“Only two or three notes are below
pitch, perhaps I can put them right.”</p>

<p>“Do try,” she begged, and Barnard obediently
struck the tuning-fork.</p>

<p>Janet’s belief that her “not at home” message
would send Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper away, was not
well founded. Henderson’s information caused that
determined matron to hesitate for a second only,
then she inquired for Mr. Calderon Fordyce.</p>

<p>“Ask him if he will see me for a few moments
on a matter of importance,” she added, detecting the
footman’s embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Miss Langdon do?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” and somewhat overawed by her
air of authority, he showed her and Pauline into
the reception-room and went to tell his master of
their presence.</p>

<p>“Asked for me personally, Henderson?” questioned
Calderon Fordyce, examining the visiting-cards
attentively.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper declared Miss
Langdon would not do; that she had to see you on
a matter of importance, sir.”</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Duncan returned?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>Fordyce cast a regretful look at the letter he was
engaged in writing when interrupted, and rose. “Did
you show the ladies into the drawing-room?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; they’re in the reception-room,” Henderson
followed his master out into the hall. “If you
please, sir,” he began deferentially. “Don’t take
the ladies into the drawing-room, sir; Miss Janet is
there with a caller, and I don’t think she wishes to be
disturbed, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” and hastening his footsteps, Fordyce
went directly to the reception-room. Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper
returned his greeting with such impressiveness
that his eyes twinkled. “Please pardon me for
keeping you waiting,” he began, after shaking hands
with Pauline.</p>

<p>“We had not meant to disturb you,” chimed in
Pauline, “but your footman said Mrs. Fordyce was
indisposed.”</p>

<p>“And our errand is really very important,” interrupted
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper, “otherwise we would
not have insisted on seeing you.”</p>

<p>Calderon Fordyce looked at his guests in some
perplexity, but their serious manner impressed him,
and he said slowly, “In that case we had better adjourn
to my library; we can have no privacy in this
room. Will you come this way?”</p>

<p>It was the first time Mrs. J. Calhoun-Cooper had
been in the library, and she surveyed the handsomely
furnished room with some envy. Calderon Fordyce’s
“Now, madame,” brought her back to her
errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Possibly Janet told you of the disappearance of
my pearl necklace at the ball last night?”</p>

<p>“My son spoke to me about it. Have you taken
any steps to recover the necklace?”</p>

<p>“My husband has placed the matter in the hands
of detectives,” Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper cleared her
throat. “The necklace is really very valuable, the
pearls being graduated in size and of wonderful
luster. It took my husband years to collect them&mdash;&mdash;”
her voice gave out.</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry for your loss,” said Fordyce
gravely. “Have you no clue by which the thief might
be traced?”</p>

<p>“We have,” answered Pauline quickly. “And
that brings us here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t take your meaning,” Calderon Fordyce’s
heavy eyebrows met in an unmistakable frown.</p>

<p>“We are convinced that mother’s necklace was
stolen by Miss Marjorie Langdon.”</p>

<p>Fordyce’s eyes opened wide. “Preposterous nonsense!”
he jerked out with more force than elegance.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to contradict you,” Pauline’s thin lips
closed obstinately. “There is no doubt but that she
is guilty.”</p>

<p>“You are really in earnest?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. We came here this morning to warn
your wife, Mr. Fordyce, and not being able to see
her, decided that it was our duty to tell you of Miss
Langdon’s dishonesty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” dryly. Fordyce regarded his
visitors in incredulous silence for some seconds, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>excusing himself, stepped past them into the hall.
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper exchanged an uneasy glance
with her daughter, but had not opportunity to voice
her thoughts, for Calderon Fordyce re-entered the
room almost immediately, followed by Marjorie,
whom he met returning from her shopping expedition.</p>

<p>“As your statements were not made in confidence,
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper,” he said, “I must ask you to
repeat them before Miss Langdon.”</p>

<p>Marjorie, having received no inkling as to why
her presence was desired in the library, gazed from
one to the other in bewilderment and growing dread.</p>

<p>Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper flushed and her eyes
flashed angrily. “I shall have no hesitancy in repeating
my charges”&mdash;Marjorie’s start was not lost
on the others. “Miss Langdon, I demand that you
instantly return my pearl necklace which you stole
from me last night at the ball.”</p>

<p>“You’re mad!” burst out Marjorie. “I haven’t
your necklace.”</p>

<p>“Lies won’t do, my girl!” Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s
native coarseness was gaining the upper
hand under the pressure of excitement and rage which
almost mastered her. “I felt you fumbling with the
clasp of the necklace.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And why didn’t you speak of it at the
time?”</p>

<p>“Because my attention was distracted, and when I
turned back to speak to you, you had vanished.”</p>

<p>“With the necklace,” added Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“Not so fast!” Marjorie’s indignation almost
choked her utterance, and she stopped to regain control
of her voice. “The robbery took place while I
was still at the supper-table, ten stories beneath the
ballroom.”</p>

<p>“The necklace disappeared earlier in the evening,”
explained Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper, “for I missed
it on my return to the ballroom immediately after
supper.”</p>

<p>“You have only your word to support such a
statement,” retorted Marjorie swiftly. “I deny your
charge absolutely. Oh, Mr. Fordyce,” turning appealingly
to him, “do have faith in my word.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” his hearty assurance brought
tears of relief to Marjorie’s eyes. “Miss Marjorie,
during the evening, did you see anyone enter
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s box who might be the real
thief?”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s eyes never wavered before her questioner’s
gaze. “I am afraid I can give you no information
or clue which will help in tracing the
robber,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” Fordyce shook his head. “I think,
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper, you had better wait and see
what the detectives can do to trace your necklace.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, Mr. Fordyce, that you do
not believe me when I state that Miss Langdon stole
my necklace?”</p>

<p>“I do, madame; unless you can get someone to
substantiate your statement.”</p>

<p>“Ask her, she knows,” burst out Pauline, pointing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>to a shadowy figure standing near the half-open door.
With one accord they turned in that direction, and
faced by the four pairs of eyes, Janet came reluctantly
forward.</p>

<p>Marjorie turned sick as her thoughts raced to the
delicate, kindly mother upstairs and the upright,
idolizing father&mdash;how would they bear the disclosure
of Janet’s kleptomania? The moment she dreaded
had come at last.</p>

<p>“Well, Janet,” her father’s curt voice cut the
silence. “What do you know of the disappearance
of Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s pearl necklace?”</p>

<p>Janet’s eyes rested for a moment on Marjorie,
then traveled back to her father.</p>

<p>“I saw Marjorie steal the necklace,” she said
quietly.</p>

<p>Marjorie’s low cry of horror was drowned in
Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s triumphant shout.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” Calderon Fordyce’s face had grown
very grave. “Janet, are you telling the absolute
truth?” Never had he spoken in that tone before to
her, and Janet whitened.</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“How did Miss Marjorie steal the necklace?”
The question cost him an effort.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper requested her to replace
her scarf about her shoulders,” Janet spoke more
and more slowly and with growing reluctance.
“When Marjorie lowered her hand, I saw the end
of the pearl necklace hanging from it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“And you said nothing?”</p>

<p>“No, father.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t absolutely certain&mdash;I’ve kept quiet since,
because I could not bear to betray Marjorie.”</p>

<p>Calderon Fordyce broke the tense silence.</p>

<p>“Miss Marjorie, can you deny my daughter’s
statement?”</p>

<p>Marjorie was ghastly as she straightened up and
faced her accusers; Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper and Pauline
openly triumphant, Calderon Fordyce, stern, unbending;
and Janet, pitying. Janet’s features were
strangely like and unlike Duncan’s, and the elusive
likeness haunted Marjorie.</p>

<p>Twice she strove to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use?” she cried, and laughing
hysterically, fled from the room.</p>

<span class="smaller">WATCHFUL WAITING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“C</span>an</span> I see Dr. Potter?” inquired Duncan,
handing his visiting-card to Mrs. Walbridge’s
butler.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fordyce, sir?” interrogatively, and Duncan
nodded assent. “The Doctor is waiting for
you, sir. Please step this way”&mdash;but before they
reached the drawing-room, Paul Potter appeared in
the hall.</p>

<p>“Very glad to see you, Duncan,” he said warmly.
“Nobody’s home but myself, so come into the Judge’s
den; we can talk undisturbed there.”</p>

<p>“I was detained in reaching here. I wanted particularly
to see you alone. I had to drop Janet at
home first; she went out with me to try my new
roadster,” explained Duncan, following Potter into
the cozy room which Judge Walbridge used as his
sanctum sanctorum. “Mother wishes to know if you
will dine informally with us tonight; only a few
friends are coming in.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to. It happens that Judge
and Mrs. Walbridge are dining out, an engagement
they made before I came, so I shall not upset any
of their plans,” replied Potter. “Come over here to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>the light and let me get a good look at you,” indicating
a seat by the window. “Um, a clear bill of
health”&mdash;inspecting him carefully.</p>

<p>“Only older than when you saw me last,” smiled
Duncan, “and wiser.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” dryly, noting the unusual lines about
Duncan’s eyes and mouth. “And does wisdom bring
happiness?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” with unusual abruptness. “It’s
good to see you again, Paul; where have you been
since I left you in South America?”</p>

<p>“Knocking about the world. The wanderlust is
ruining me, Duncan; I cannot make up my mind to
seriously sit down in San Francisco and resume my
practice.”</p>

<p>“As you are called in consultation by other physicians
in every State of the Union, I’m not worrying
about your financial condition,” retorted Duncan,
examining the famous alienist carefully in his turn.
“I’m much more concerned over your health&mdash;how
are you these days?”</p>

<p>“Splendid, never felt better.” Six years before
Paul Potter had suffered a severe nervous breakdown
from overwork, and he had accompanied Duncan on
a trip to China, where the latter went to attend to
some business for his father, who was one of the
largest importers from that country. Potter was
some fifteen years Duncan’s senior, but they were
congenial in their tastes, and after a year’s sojourn
in China had, on their return, traveled together in
other countries. “Are you still as confirmed a bachelor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
as ever, Duncan? Or is there a ‘not impossible
she’ in the background?”</p>

<p>“Still a bachelor,” admitted Duncan. “I am
doubly glad to have you in Washington now on my
mother’s account.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to ask for her,” and Potter’s
manner became serious. “How is she?”</p>

<p>“In many respects much better, but she is far from
strong.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry indeed to hear that,” in quick sympathy.
“Is she still troubled with mysophobia?”</p>

<p>“To a limited degree.” Duncan accepted the
cigar offered him, and settled back in his chair.
“Mother no longer insists on washing her own knives
and forks, and takes her meals with us if no company
is present; but she still has her dread of soiled
money.”</p>

<p>“That also may wear off in time,” said the physician
reflectively. “Is her general health good?”</p>

<p>“Except for valvular weakness of the heart. Poor
little mother!” Duncan paused and cleared his
throat. “Curious she should have developed such a
morbid fear of contact with dirt.”</p>

<p>“You must remember the human mind is a wonderful
piece of mechanism, so delicately adjusted that
the slightest jar throws it out of gear. That frightful
railroad accident, in which your mother was half
killed, was chiefly responsible for her mental condition
afterwards. I am delighted to hear that she is
improving.”</p>

<p>“Mother insists on leading the life of a hermit,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>hardly sees anyone outside the family. Do you think
it is good for her to be so much alone?”</p>

<p>“It is not good for anyone to shun their fellowmen,”
responded Potter decidedly. “Keep your
mother interested in present-day matters. I should
think your pretty sister could manage that.”</p>

<p>“Mother turned Janet over to an official chaperon.”</p>

<p>“Hard on your sister,” commented Potter sympathetically.
“And not wise for your mother;
having shifted her responsibilities, she’ll feel at
liberty to indulge her morbid tendencies.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Duncan puffed nervously at his cigar.
“Mother did not pick out the usual type of chaperon
for Janet, so your sympathies for my sister are
wasted.”</p>

<p>“Good. Janet has changed very little; as I
remember she was a pretty schoolgirl, now she is
an exquisitely pretty débutante.”</p>

<p>“She has inherited her good looks from mother.
What do you think of Miss Langdon? She was with
me when I met you last night,” he added, to complete
the identification.</p>

<p>“A beautiful girl; I’m not surprised you walked
over the rest of us mortals when dancing with
her.”</p>

<p>Duncan fidgeted in his chair. “I’m hard hit in
that quarter,” he admitted slowly.</p>

<p>“She’s lucky,” commented Potter tersely. “Are
congratulations in order?” He regretted the question
as he saw Duncan wince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“Unfortunately for me, no.” Duncan had turned
a shade paler under the strain of the emotion he was
striving to suppress. “I would never have mentioned
this topic had it not been for extraordinary circumstances”&mdash;he
stopped and looked carefully about the
room. Seeing the hall door was closed, and there
was apparently no danger of being overheard, he
continued, “Will you please treat what I am about to
say as confidential?”</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear fellow,” deeply interested,
Potter laid down his cigar and moved his chair
nearer.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon has been with Janet as, you might
say, resident chaperon....”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she very young for such a responsible position?”</p>

<p>“Mother did not think so. Miss Langdon is really
more of a companion for Janet; knows the right
people to introduce to her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see, a ‘guide, philosopher, and friend,’
idea....”</p>

<p>“Yes,” slowly. “Miss Langdon has been with
Janet since the first week in November. During that
time she has conducted herself as a woman of refinement
and good breeding would; she has done
everything possible to see that Janet has a good time.
Mother swears by her&mdash;says she cannot get on without
her,” he paused, considering his words with care.
“My intercourse with Miss Langdon has been of the
most conventional character; in her eyes I am simply
Janet’s elder brother....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Well, where is the fly in the ointment?” inquired
Potter. “Other suitors?”</p>

<p>“As many as she wants,” quietly. “It is not they
who are troubling me.”</p>

<p>“No?” in a tone of some unbelief. “Well, what
then?”</p>

<p>Duncan spoke with an apparent effort. “Some
extraordinary robberies have taken place recently....”
A low whistle escaped Potter.</p>

<p>“In your house and since Miss Langdon’s arrival?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; and&mdash;and&mdash;in another house before she
came to us....”</p>

<p>“I see&mdash;the trail of the serpent....”</p>

<p>“Don’t make comments until I have finished,”
retorted Duncan, ruffled by Potter’s manner.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” good-naturedly. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>But it was some moments before Duncan complied
with the request.</p>

<p>“I have come to you with my problem,” he began
finally, “because I have an idea it may be in your
province.”</p>

<p>“Ah. Under what heading?”</p>

<p>“Kleptomania.”</p>

<p>Potter elevated his eyebrows. “It is a recognized
mental derangement,” he conceded.</p>

<p>“Curable?”</p>

<p>“Doubtful.” Potter forebore to look at Duncan;
instinctively he knew the hope his friend was pinning
on him and his advice. “Has Miss Langdon ever
had scarlet fever?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why?”</p>

<p>“A severe attack sometimes leaves the brain in a
weakened condition and a convalescent patient might
become afflicted with an uncontrollable propensity to
pilfer shining objects. If such an impulse is not
checked at the outset by medical treatment it may
gradually develop in a monomania for thieving,”
answered Potter. “Do you believe Miss Langdon
is a kleptomaniac?”</p>

<p>“I do&mdash;it is the only grounds on which I can explain
her conduct.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you give me some of the details of the
robberies for which you think Miss Langdon is
responsible,” suggested the physician.</p>

<p>Quickly and tersely Duncan described the loss of
his father’s forty dollars, which had first aroused
his suspicions of Marjorie’s honesty; then related
all that Admiral Lawrence had confided to
him about the stolen codicil. “And to cap the
climax,” he concluded, “comes the theft of Mrs.
Calhoun-Cooper’s pearl necklace at the ball last
night.”</p>

<p>After he ceased speaking, Potter, who had listened
to his account with absorbed attention, rose and
slowly paced the room in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Have you any direct proof that Miss Langdon
is implicated in the loss of the necklace?” he asked,
resuming his seat.</p>

<p>“No, none; only an intolerable fear&mdash;&mdash;” Duncan’s
voice shook.</p>

<p>“I understand.” Potter tugged at the lobe of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>right ear until it crimsoned. “Is Miss Langdon
poor?”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” dryly. “Otherwise she would hardly
be earning her own living.”</p>

<p>“Very poor,” insistently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” answered Duncan
doubtfully. “She dresses extremely well....”</p>

<p>“That signifies nothing; the clothes may have
been given her by wealthy friends. Has Miss Langdon
any relatives dependent upon her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a great-aunt; a lovely old Quakeress. Why
do you ask?”</p>

<p>“A woman will steal for another when she would
not steal for herself....”</p>

<p>“Sentiment would not influence a kleptomaniac.”</p>

<p>“The mantel of kleptomania, like charity, covers
a multitude of sins,” retorted Potter. “Let me explain,”
he added, as Duncan’s color rose. “Kleptomaniacs
are usually found among the wealthy class;
their pleasure is derived from the <i>act</i> of stealing, not
in the thing stolen. For instance, a man, possessing
a handsome gold watch-chain, will steal a dozen
chains, but once the desire to steal is gratified, he
never cares to sell or wear the stolen chains; he may
even return them to their rightful owners. Now,
back of every robbery you cite against Miss Langdon,
lies personal gain&mdash;the acquisition of forty
dollars....”</p>

<p>“A small sum for which to ruin oneself,” protested
Duncan, fighting stubbornly against his own
doubts as well as Potter’s arguments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“The size of the sum is only relative, according to
the need for the money. In your eyes forty dollars
seems trivial; but perhaps Miss Langdon may
have considered the money worth the risk she
took.”</p>

<p>“She could have gone to mother,” burst in Duncan.</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon may have feared a refusal. Suppose
we take up the lost codicil....”</p>

<p>“Marjorie Langdon did not benefit by its disappearance.”</p>

<p>“No, but a friend stands to do so&mdash;a man with
whom, according to Admiral Lawrence, Miss Langdon
was infatuated. The inheritance of one hundred
thousand dollars would permit them to
marry....”</p>

<p>“Supposing she really is in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Have you reason to doubt it?”</p>

<p>Duncan did not answer immediately. “I cannot
believe Marjorie is the type of girl to commit theft,
or to center her affections on a man who is not
worthy of her.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything against him?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no; but Mrs. Lawrence found it necessary
to disinherit Barnard.”</p>

<p>“Did the Admiral give you the reason for his
wife’s act?”</p>

<p>“She said she was angry at some investments made
for her by Barnard which had turned out disastrously.”</p>

<p>“A lack of business sense is nothing against a man’s
moral character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“That’s true,” acknowledged Duncan. “I admit
I’m prejudiced against Barnard.”</p>

<p>“Do you see much of him?”</p>

<p>“Quite a good deal; he comes frequently to the
house, ostensibly to see Janet, but I suspect in reality
to be near Marjorie Langdon.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he’s playing off the two girls
against each other?”</p>

<p>“He had better not,” Duncan’s teeth came together
with a snap. “No, Janet’s whole thoughts seem to be
turned to Captain Nichols; she accepts Barnard’s
attentions, that is all.”</p>

<p>“And how does Miss Langdon look on Barnard’s
attentions to Janet?”</p>

<p>“Her manner gives me no inkling of what she
thinks.”</p>

<p>“She must be a good actress,” commented Potter.
“No woman, who commits a criminal act for a
lover, will stand tamely by and see that lover devote
himself to another woman unless she has marvelous
self-control....”</p>

<p>“Or no real affection for the supposed lover,” put
in Duncan. “At dinner tonight you can study them
for yourself; both Miss Langdon and Chichester
Barnard will be there.”</p>

<p>“Good.” Potter rose and placed his hand affectionately
on Duncan’s shoulder. “I judge more by
what you have left unsaid, Duncan, of how you feel
about the girl. I would to heaven I could help you!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Duncan’s tone was a trifle husky. “I’m
afraid there’s nothing anyone can do for me. I must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>‘dree my weird.’ But,” his clenched fist came down
with a resounding whack on the broad ledge of his
Morris-chair arm. “I firmly believe that if Marjorie
did steal the codicil, the money, and the pearl necklace,
she did it unknowingly, in response to a craze
to steal which she could not govern.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. It may be, Duncan, if
Miss Langdon submits to a medical examination....”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask mother to seat you next to Miss Langdon
at dinner,” Duncan stood up. “Perhaps then you
can decide what is best to be done. Come over early,
Paul, I want you to see mother before the other
guests arrive.”</p>

<p>“I will.” Potter accompanied Duncan to the
closed door and before opening it, added earnestly,
“I have not meant to be unfeeling, Duncan, in my efforts
to differentiate between stealing as a criminal
act, and stealing as an insane impulse.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Paul,” hastily. “I came to you
for advice, and I know you will help me if you can.
Please remember me to Judge and Mrs. Walbridge,”
and speaking on other subjects, the two friends made
their way to the front door, and Duncan started
homeward.</p>

<p>As Duncan motored slowly up Massachusetts
Avenue he recognized a familiar figure coming toward
him, and making a wide turning, faced his car
in the direction Marjorie was going and quickly
caught up with her. She was so absorbed in her
thoughts that she had no idea of his presence until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>he called her by name. As his voice reached her, she
started so violently that her hand-bag slipped from
her fingers to the pavement, but before she could
stoop to pick it up he was by her side.</p>

<p>“Are you on your way to a luncheon?” he asked,
straightening up and placing the bag in her extended
hand. “Great heavens! What is the matter?” getting
a full look at her tragic face. “Has anything happened
to your aunt?”</p>

<p>“No. Oh, no,” she replied hurriedly. “You
startled me, coming up so quietly.”</p>

<p>Duncan took her hand in his with an air of quiet
authority. “Tell me, what is really the matter?”</p>

<p>Marjorie steeled herself against the tender solicitude
in his voice and gesture. What use to tell him
of the scene in his father’s library? He also would
take Janet’s word against hers. He would believe
her a thief. In the silent watches of the past anxious
nights, she had awakened to the realization that she
had come to love Duncan with an adoration which
passes understanding. It was her precious secret;
he must never guess it. Her past affection for Chichester
Barnard had been the shadow instead of the
substance. Her endurance was almost at the breaking
point; she could not face the loss of Duncan’s
friendship, at least not then; nor see admiration
change to contempt, and liking sink to loathing.
With a muttered prayer for strength, she raised her
eyes to Duncan’s.</p>

<p>“If you must know the truth,” she said, “I’m suffering
from a toothache&mdash;not a bit romantic, is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” sympathetically. “But I know
from experience there’s no pain like it. If you are
on your way to the dentist, can’t I take you there?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t see me until four o’clock this afternoon,”
lying with trembling lips. “I am going to
Aunt Yvonett’s to rest quietly until then.”</p>

<p>“Let me drive you there,” pointing persuasively
toward his roadster. Marjorie could think of no
adequate excuse; after all it would be the quickest
and easiest way to reach the shelter of her aunt’s
house.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t taking you out of your way&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t,” heartily. “Mind that step,”
and in a second more he was seated beside her, and
the powerful car moved off down Massachusetts
Avenue. “How do you like my new model?” patting
the side of the motor. “I had an old one in San
Francisco.”</p>

<p>“The car moves very smoothly,” with well simulated
interest. “Is she speedy?”</p>

<p>“Is she? You should have seen me trying her
out on the Conduit Road this morning; I brought
Janet home in record time.”</p>

<p>“Worse luck,” she groaned, below her breath.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” But she pretended not to
hear, and he continued, “I want to ask you to be very
nice to a friend of mine tonight who will sit next you
at dinner.”</p>

<p>She moved restlessly. “Who is the man?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Paul Potter. I introduced him to you last
night. Haven’t you heard of him before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“I believe your sister said he attended your mother
when she was ill.”</p>

<p>“He was called in consultation. I thought you
might have heard of Potter, he’s a famous brain
specialist. We traveled together in the East; he’s
deeply interested in that land of mysticism and occultism.
You’ll find him an interesting talker.”</p>

<p>“Probably I will.” Marjorie’s fingers twitched
spasmodically over her hand-bag. Her frayed
nerves were giving way. “Would you mind stopping
at the Portland Drug Store? I think I can get
some&mdash;some iodine.”</p>

<p>“Does your tooth pain you very much?” asked
Duncan, turning the car into wide Vermont Avenue
and stopping before the drug store which occupied
the ground floor of one end of the large triangular
apartment house. “Can’t I run in and get it for
you?”</p>

<p>“No, no, sit still.” Her imperative tone stopped
him as he was about to arise. “The druggist can
perhaps advise me what to do, I had better ask him
myself&mdash;I&mdash;I shan’t be long.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait, never fear,” laughed Duncan, settling
back in his seat. He watched with grave solicitude
the tall, graceful girl walk up the long approach
through the parking and enter the drug store.</p>

<p>The minutes passed and Duncan finally waxed impatient.
Glancing at his watch, he found he had
been waiting nearly twenty minutes. A thought occurred
to him; suppose Marjorie had fainted from
pain and exhaustion? She had looked on the point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>of a breakdown when she left him. With a bound
he was out of the car and into the drug store. One
glance around the shop showed him the place was
empty except for a clerk.</p>

<p>“Where’s the young lady who came in here a short
time ago to buy some iodine?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t any one bought iodine,” protested the
clerk. “Do you mean the young lady who came in
about twenty minutes ago and walked through the
store and out into Fourteenth Street?” pointing to
the door opposite the one Duncan was holding partly
open as he gazed in consternation and bewilderment
at the clerk.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STORM CENTER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>adame Yvonett</span>, knitting industriously
as she sat in the bow window of her small
parlor, watched a smart victoria drive up
to the curb and stop before her door. There was no
one in the carriage, and thinking the coachman had
made a mistake in the number of the house, she was
about to ring for Minerva when that dusky maid-of-all-work
appeared in the doorway, dressed in hat
and coat.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, madam,” she said respectfully. “Hab
Miss Rebekah come in?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Minerva’s face fell; she had received
strict orders from Marjorie never to leave Madame
Yvonett alone in the house. “I am expecting her
to return at any moment. Does thee wish to go
out?”</p>

<p>“Yass’m; Miss Rebekah done tole me she’d be
back by three, so’s I could go to George Henry’s
funeral at fo’ o’clock.”</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett glanced at the clock; the hands
pointed to twenty minutes past three. “Don’t wait
any longer,” she directed kindly. “I will watch for
Miss Rebekah and let her in when she comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>Minerva wavered between desire and her sense
of responsibility.</p>

<p>“I done locked de kitchen do’, an’ all de winders
in de basement,” she volunteered hopefully. “Miss
Rebekah kain’t be much longer.”</p>

<p>“Thee must not wait,” and Madame Yvonett’s
tone of decision removed Minerva’s doubts. “I have
the telephone if I require aid. On thy way out,
Minerva, tell the coachman he is stopping at the
wrong house.”</p>

<p>“No, madam, he ain’t,” protested Minerva hastily.
“George Henry b’longed ter my burial sassiety, an’
dey sent a kerrage ter take me ter de funeral.”</p>

<p>“A victoria, Minerva?” Madame Yvonett’s astonishment
keyed her voice to a higher pitch.</p>

<p>“Yass’m.” Minerva’s smile of satisfaction showed
every tooth in her head. “De burial committee axed
me what I done want, an’ I tole dem I wished one
ob dem ‘lay backs.’ I’se allus hoped ter ride in one
like white folks; ye see, poverty ain’t no disgrace,
but it’s mighty onconvenient. I’ll be hyar in time ter
get supper, madam.” And she departed hastily,
fearing Madame Yvonett might change her mind
and insist on her staying until Miss Rebekah Graves
returned.</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett chuckled softly to herself as she
watched Minerva enter the victoria and drive off in
state. The victoria, with its triumphant occupant,
had hardly turned into K Street, before Madame
Yvonett descried Miss Rebekah Graves trudging
across Franklin Park, intent on taking the shortest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>cut home. The Quakeress was at the front door to
meet her when she reached the steps.</p>

<p>“Do not trouble to go to thy room to remove thy
wraps, Becky,” she said. “Take them off here, and
come into the parlor, it is the warmest room in the
house. Thee must be cold,” eyeing the pinched lips
and red nose of the spinster with much sympathy.</p>

<p>Miss Rebekah sniffed as she inspected the narrow
confines of the small hall, and compromised the matter
by walking into the dining-room and leaving her
hat and coat there. On entering the parlor she found
Madame Yvonett had resumed her knitting, and she
paused a moment to smooth back several gray locks
in the severe style which she affected to dress her
hair.</p>

<p>“Did thee find affairs satisfactory at the Home?”
questioned Madame Yvonett.</p>

<p>“I did not,” seating herself near Madame
Yvonett. “Two girls whom the matron rescued,
have returned to their wicked ways.”</p>

<p>“If thee made virtue less detestable, Becky, thee
would have more true converts.”</p>

<p>“You are entirely too lax in your views,” retorted
Miss Rebekah, nettled by her cousin’s criticism. “I
warned you years ago that evil would come if you
indulged Marjorie too much.”</p>

<p>“Thee did thy best to warn me, Becky,” admitted
the Quakeress, taking no pains to conceal her amusement.
“I give thee credit for plain speaking.”</p>

<p>“I fear your reward will be less.” Miss Rebekah’s
temper had been sorely tried by the long ride in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>cold wind, and like many another she ached to vent
her ill-humor on some one. “Marjorie has fallen
from the path of rectitude and honor.”</p>

<p>“Rebekah!” Madame’s steel knitting needles
were not as bright as the flash in her eyes as she
regarded the irate spinster. “Take heed to what
thee says; my patience is small this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I mean exactly what I say. Did Marjorie tell
you she was discharged by Admiral Lawrence?”</p>

<p>The Quakeress laid down her needles. “No.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought she would not dare.”</p>

<p>“Explain thyself, Rebekah.”</p>

<p>“I met Admiral Lawrence this morning; he asked
me to acquaint you with the fact that he discharged
Marjorie for stealing”&mdash;Madame Yvonett’s hand
sought her heart as if to still its sudden throb, and
her face went gray&mdash;“for stealing a codicil to his
wife’s will in which Mrs. Lawrence disinherited
Chichester Barnard,” finished Miss Rebekah, her
small triumph blinding her to the agony she had inflicted
on her aged kinswoman. Had not Marjorie’s
“going wrong” fulfilled her prophecy? She had always
been jealous of Madame Yvonett’s affection
for her greatniece, and had treasured each careless
action and thoughtless word Marjorie had been
guilty of to her, the better to nurse her spite against
the young girl. But Admiral Lawrence, in asking her
to break the news of the codicil’s loss, his suspicions,
and proposed legal action to Madame Yvonett, had
placed a double-edged sword in her hand. Ever
ready to believe evil of her fellowmen and women,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>the spinster never doubted that Madame Yvonett
would instantly credit Admiral Lawrence’s charge
against Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Thee is mad; quite mad!” gasped the Quakeress,
as soon as she recovered her breath. “I am surprised
thee dares to come to me with such lies!”</p>

<p>“Lies? Do you doubt Admiral Lawrence’s
word?” Miss Rebekah’s eyes were round with
wonder.</p>

<p>“Of course I doubt it. Does thee think for one
moment I would believe ill of my Marjorie?” Her
fine voice trembled with passionate intentness.
“Thee is madder than I first supposed, Rebekah.”
The spinster quailed before her scorn. “Answer
the front door, the bell has been ringing for some
moments; then thee can go to thy room and pack thy
trunk.”</p>

<p>Confused by the way her news had been received,
the spinster backed hastily out of the room, tears
streaming down her face. But Madame Yvonett
did not weep; the wound her cousin had inflicted was
too deep to be healed so easily. With tightly compressed
lips and flashing eyes she sat straight in her
high back chair, listening to a spirited argument that
was taking place in the hall. Suddenly the portières
parted and a handsome young woman, dressed in the
extreme of fashion, stepped into the room, followed
by the protesting spinster.</p>

<p>“Are you Madame Yvonett?” she inquired of the
Quakeress. “I am Miss Calhoun-Cooper. I called
to see your niece, Marjorie Langdon. This person”&mdash;indicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
Miss Rebekah with a rude tilt of her
head, “informs me she is not here.” The spinster’s
face was a study as she glared at Pauline.</p>

<p>“Thee has been told the truth,” answered the
Quakeress, inspecting her visitor with interest. “My
niece is not here.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s as I suspected; she’s made a quick get-away!”
exclaimed Pauline.</p>

<p>“Thy manners leave much to be desired, and thy
speech more so,” replied Madame Yvonett with
gentle dignity. “If thee will express thyself in correct
English, I may be able to understand thee and
answer thy remark.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” sneered Pauline, her desire to hurt
stirred by the merited rebuke. “Then, in plain English&mdash;your
niece is a thief, and she has run away
with my mother’s pearl necklace.”</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett sat immovable under the blow;
not by the flicker of an eyelash did she show the
agony she was enduring. Miss Rebekah, quite unaware
that she had left the front door wide open,
stood enthralled, watching the scene.</p>

<p>“Thee has made a statement which I can both
understand and refute,” said Madame Yvonett
slowly. “My niece would never stoop to such dishonorable
actions as thee accuses her of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She will have a chance to clear herself of the
charge in a criminal court, <i>if</i> she can,” broke in
Pauline with brutal frankness. “My mother and I
are quite determined to push the matter to the end.”</p>

<p>“Thy determination is as nothing compared to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>mine,” retorted Madame Yvonett. “Marjorie’s
innocence will be proved, and those who have traduced
her shall suffer.”</p>

<p>“Threats don’t bother me,” Pauline shrugged her
shoulders disdainfully. “Janet Fordyce saw Marjorie
Langdon steal the necklace from mother”&mdash;Madame
Yvonett swayed backward; then by a supreme
effort, recovered from the deadly faintness
which threatened to overcome her. “The Fordyces
acknowledge her guilt, and have turned her out of
their house.”</p>

<p>“The more shame to them.” The Quakeress
rose abruptly to her feet, her eyes blazing with pent-up
wrath. “I care not who accuses my niece&mdash;she
is innocent of all wrong-doing; and so I will contend
with my feeble strength and wit before the world”&mdash;in
spite of every effort, she was trembling from head
to foot. “My feet are already turned toward
Eternity, but God will spare me to right so monstrous
an injustice against an upright, honorable girl, whose
only crime is poverty.”</p>

<p>Pauline’s unpleasant laugh was checked by the
sudden entrance of a tall man who brushed her unceremoniously
to one side.</p>

<p>“Madame Yvonett,” said Duncan clearly. “I
share your faith in Marjorie&mdash;&mdash;” A low cry
burst from the Quakeress, and tears, which no jeer
of Pauline’s had been able to call forth, rushed to
her eyes. Blindly she caught Duncan’s strong hand
and held it close in her trembling fingers. “Marjorie
was not turned out of my father’s house, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>left of her own accord,” continued Duncan. “Why
this young lady should maliciously distort facts”&mdash;Pauline
changed color as she met his contemptuous
gaze&mdash;“she alone can explain.”</p>

<p>“You are very unjust,” protested Pauline. “I was
but quoting Janet; I did not realize your sister’s
word was&mdash;unreliable.”</p>

<p>But the gibe passed unnoticed except by Paul Potter,
who had entered a few minutes before with
Duncan, and remained standing in the hall. On their
arrival they had found the front door wide open, and
had been unintentional listeners to Pauline’s charges
against Marjorie; the girl’s penetrating voice having
carried each word to them with absolute distinctness.</p>

<p>“I hoped, Madame Yvonett, that this misunderstanding
in which your niece is involved, would not
reach your ears,” said Duncan. “I am sure if Miss
Calhoun-Cooper pauses to reflect, she will say nothing
further on the subject to anyone.”</p>

<p>Pauline had indeed been thinking rapidly. It was
one thing to brow-beat Madame Yvonett, quite
another to antagonize so influential a family as the
Fordyces. Her social ambitions might easily be
nipped in the bud if Duncan pursued his quixotic
course and persuaded his parents to drop the Calhoun-Coopers
from their acquaintance. Quickly
she decided to modify her tone.</p>

<p>“Of course I will not mention the matter to outsiders,”
she said. “But mother and I will listen to
no compromise unless the pearl necklace is given
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“Thee must go elsewhere for thy pearls,” declared
Madame Yvonett undauntedly. Tom’s account of
the loss of his coin flashed into her mind. “Why
does thee not question thy brother about the pearls?”</p>

<p>“What need?” but Pauline’s fingers clenched in
her muff as she put the contemptuous question.
“Miss Fordyce’s testimony is most convincing&mdash;she
saw Miss Langdon steal the necklace.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” interrupted Duncan. “My
mother, Miss Calhoun-Cooper, will make good your
loss, if necessary; but first,” his voice deepened&mdash;“I
shall take steps to clear Miss Langdon of this
preposterous charge, and bring the real thief to
book.”</p>

<p>Madame Yvonett’s expressive look thanked him;
then she faced Pauline.</p>

<p>“Thee came uninvited to my house; thee has
shown me more discourtesy than I have ever met
with before&mdash;considering the source I am hardly
surprised.” Pauline shrank back as she met the
beautiful, scornful eyes. “Thee has dared to besmirk
my niece’s character; for that I will never
forgive thee. Thee may go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” and tossing her head, Pauline
left the room and house, banging the front door shut
with a violence that shook windowpanes and pictures.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence; then Madame
Yvonett turned back to Duncan. “How can I ever
thank thee?” she murmured brokenly.</p>

<p>“By letting me see Miss Langdon,” taking her
out-stretched hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“But Marjorie is not here&mdash;I have not seen her
since yesterday.”</p>

<p>Duncan gazed incredulously at her, then a worried
expression crossed his face. “Do you mean she has
not been here at all today?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But she told me when I met her she was coming
straight here,” he protested. “She left me, for some
unknown reason, at the Portland Drug Store and, I
supposed, returned here.”</p>

<p>“At what hour was that?” demanded Madame
Yvonett, growing a shade paler.</p>

<p>“About twenty minutes past one.”</p>

<p>“Did she have any clothes with her?”</p>

<p>“No, she only carried a hand-bag. Janet told me
before I left the house that her things were still in
her room.”</p>

<p>“Did Marjorie seem distraught?” Madame
Yvonett moistened her dry lips, a new terror tugging
at her heart-strings.</p>

<p>“No, only nervous.” The answer was reassuring,
but Duncan’s manner was not, and with a low moan
of anguish Madame Yvonett sank unconscious to the
ground.</p>

<p>Paul Potter sprang to Duncan’s assistance, and the
two men, under Miss Rebekah’s frightened guidance,
carried Madame Yvonett to her room. Once there
the skilled physician took entire charge, and to Duncan’s
immense relief, the Quakeress soon revived
under his treatment. Potter followed Duncan as he
tiptoed out into the upper hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t wait around any longer,” he whispered.
“I’ll stay here with Madame Yvonett until her
regular physician arrives and the trained nurse you
sent for. Do you still wish me to dine with you
tonight?”</p>

<p>“Of course; don’t fail me,” in some alarm. “I
must have a long talk with you. Janet refuses to
call off her dinner tonight, and father backs her up.
Mother’s not strong enough today to be dragged into
the discussion, or I would soon put an end to the
affair. Look here, Paul,” drawing out a well-filled
wallet and thrusting a handful of bills into his
friend’s hand. “See that Madame Yvonett wants
for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Potter, and disappeared inside
the sick-room.</p>

<p>Miss Rebekah was sitting disconsolately in the
lower hall as Duncan made his way to the front door.</p>

<p>“How is Madame Yvonett?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“She has regained consciousness and is resting
quietly”&mdash;the spinster’s face lighted with relief.
“You can trust absolutely to Dr. Potter,” added
Duncan. “He will remain until Madame Yvonett’s
family physician arrives.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you both,” stammered Miss
Rebekah incoherently. “What should I have done
without you!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Duncan soothingly.
“Will you do me a very great kindness, Miss
Graves?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“Then telephone me the instant Miss Langdon
returns. My number is”&mdash;drawing out his visiting-card
and writing the figures upon it. “You won’t
forget?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” and Miss Rebekah sped upstairs as
Duncan opened the front door.</p>

<p>Barely glancing at the children and nurses in the
park, he strode through Franklin Square and along
K Street absorbed in dismal reflections. After discovering
Marjorie’s disappearance from the drug
store that morning, he had returned at once to his
home deeply puzzled by her behavior. On his arrival
his father had called him into the library and
recounted the charge made against Marjorie by the
Calhoun-Coopers, Janet’s damning testimony, and
Marjorie’s flight. He had listened in stony silence,
refusing to make any comment, and after luncheon
had retired to his room. Harassed by conflicting
theories, he finally rebelled against submitting
longer to discouraging idleness, and seizing the telephone,
had sent an urgent message to Paul Potter to
meet him at the Metropolitan Club and go with him
to Madame Yvonett’s. He felt an overwhelming
desire to see Marjorie, to make her face the issue
squarely and refute, if she could, the damning evidence
against her. Anything was better than the
uncertainty he was undergoing.</p>

<p>Duncan stopped dead in his tracks. Should he go
to the police and report Marjorie’s disappearance?
Pshaw! he was a fool; the girl could have come to
no harm in broad daylight in peaceful Washington.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>She was probably sitting in some hotel, or walking
the streets trying to make up her mind to go home and
tell Madame Yvonett that she had been accused
of being a thief. Surely any girl might be excused
for putting off breaking such a piece of news to a
delicate old lady? And yet, would it not be natural
for her to rush to a near and dearly-loved relative
for consolation and advice? Duncan shook his
head in deep bewilderment. Flight was usually tacit
admission of guilt. He was so deep in thought that
he never observed an older man approaching down
the street who, on seeing him, quickened his footsteps.</p>

<p>“Well, Duncan,” and Admiral Lawrence paused
in front of him. “So you received my note.”</p>

<p>“Note?” Duncan shook his head. “No, sir, I’ve
had no note from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you were on your way to see me in
answer to it,” replied the Admiral thoughtfully. “I
have filed suit to break the will.”</p>

<p>“You are very unwise, sir,” Duncan’s eyes expressed
his indignation.</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen. Do you still propose
to defend Miss Langdon?”</p>

<p>“I do,” with quiet finality. “Who is residuary
legatee?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Then you benefit by the signing of that codicil?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; what then?”</p>

<p>“Chichester Barnard can easily retaliate by
charging you with using undue influence in persuading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>his aunt to revoke her bequest to him.” The Admiral
choked with wrath. “One hundred thousand
dollars&mdash;um!&mdash;men have done much to gain that
sum. How do I know you haven’t trumped up this
codicil charge against Marjorie Langdon as a means
to break the will?”</p>

<p>“D&mdash;mn my soul!” stormed the Admiral, getting
back his breath. “D’ye think I’m a dirty blackguard?
My lawyer, Alvord, who drew up the codicil
on October 31, is waiting to see me; come on in and
interview him now.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“In that house on the corner.” As Duncan’s gaze
swept over the unpretentious red-brick, stone-trimmed
residence, his eyes encountered those of a darky
butler who was anxiously regarding them from the
open doorway. The chords of memory were
touched, and a mental picture rose before Duncan’s
eyes. Abruptly he swung back to the Admiral.</p>

<p>“You say the codicil was drawn and signed on
October 31; when did you first discover its loss?”</p>

<p>“The morning of November first....”</p>

<p>“Let us go in and see Alvord,” interrupted Duncan,
a strange light in his eyes. Without further
words the Admiral led the way to the English basement
house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Alvord’s been awaitin’ mos’ an hour, suh,”
explained the butler, assisting them off with their
overcoats. “He axed me ter watch out an’ ax yo’
ter hurry, ’cause he’s awful busy.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Sam; where is Mr. Alvord?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“In de lib’ry, suh.”</p>

<p>“This way, Duncan,” and the Admiral piloted his
guest to the pleasant room where Marjorie had
spent so many hours. An elderly man rose on their
entrance. “Sorry to have kept you, Alvord,” apologized
the Admiral. “This is Mr. Duncan Fordyce.
Kindly tell him in detail of the signing of the codicil
to my wife’s will.”</p>

<p>Alvord glanced in some astonishment at his client;
then followed his request, and Duncan listened with
close attention as he described having Marjorie typewrite
the codicil, making two copies, and the signing
of the original copy by Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<p>“Admiral Lawrence requested me to leave the
signed codicil here, and instructed Miss Langdon to
place it in the safe,” he ended. “I gave her the
paper....”</p>

<p>“Could you take your solemn oath that you gave
her the <i>signed</i> copy?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to swear that to the best of my
recollection I gave her the signed codicil....”</p>

<p>“That’s an equivocation,” challenged Duncan
promptly.</p>

<p>“Well, what difference does it make? Only the
unsigned codicil turned up next morning. I left
a codicil, signed or unsigned, on this desk&mdash;she could
have stolen it a deal easier from the desk.”</p>

<p>“Exactly where did you place the paper?” questioned
Duncan.</p>

<p>“On this side of the desk nearest the window,”
Alvord indicated the spot with his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“You dare not swear that you handed Miss Langdon
the signed codicil because you <i>fear</i> you gave
her the unsigned one,” taunted Duncan. “Wait,”
as the harassed lawyer started to interrupt him.
“You did hand Miss Langdon the unsigned copy,
however, which was found in the safe&mdash;therefore her
responsibility in the matter ends.”</p>

<p>“Hold hard,” broke in the Admiral heatedly.
“As Alvord says, Marjorie could have stolen the
signed codicil off the desk; she was the last person to
leave this room that evening, and I the first to enter
in the morning&mdash;and the codicil was not on the desk.”</p>

<p>“You were not the <i>first</i> person to enter this room
that morning,” contradicted Duncan. “Ask your
butler to step here a moment.”</p>

<p>The Admiral hesitated, but Duncan’s earnest manner
solved his doubt, and he rang for his servant.</p>

<p>“Come in, Sam,” he directed as the butler rapped
on the door.</p>

<p>“Sam,” began Duncan slowly. “Why have you
never told Admiral Lawrence that you knocked a
valuable paper off his desk with your feather duster
and out of the open window?”</p>

<p>“Fo’ Gawd! boss, how’d yo’ know ’bout dat?”
Sam turned ashy.</p>

<p>“I was passing the house and saw the paper sail
through the window into the gutter where the water
carried it down the sewer. This was the morning
of my arrival in Washington, Admiral&mdash;November
first.”</p>

<p>The Admiral stared speechlessly at Duncan, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>wheeled on his frightened servant. “Why did you
never tell me of this?”</p>

<p>“’Cause yo’ never axed me ’bout de paper; ef yo’
had I’d a telled yer,” protested Sam. “When yo’
didn’t say nuffin’ I thought de paper wasn’t no
’count.”</p>

<p>“Go downstairs, you rascal!” thundered the Admiral,
and Sam, glad to escape, disappeared from
the room. “Well, Alvord, what d’ye think?”</p>

<p>The lawyer tugged at his mustache. “What is
your theory, Mr. Fordyce?” he asked, passing on
the Admiral’s question.</p>

<p>“That you gave the unsigned codicil to Miss
Langdon who, following instructions, placed it in the
safe where the Admiral found it the next morning.
Sam knocked the signed paper into the gutter, and
it went down the sewer.”</p>

<p>“Could you make out any writing on the paper as
it fell, Mr. Fordyce?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, no; the paper resembled an ordinary
letter size typewriting sheet, folded three
times. It spread open and fell writing down.”</p>

<p>“The codicil was written on ordinary typewriting
paper such as you describe,” admitted Alvord. “It
was the only kind Miss Langdon had here. Still,
that’s slim proof to back your theory, Mr. Fordyce.”</p>

<p>“But it will hold,” Duncan’s elation could be read
in his animated expression and excited manner. “I’m
willing to face any court, and I’ll win my case....”</p>

<p>“And that scamp, Chichester Barnard, will win his
hundred thousand after all,” groaned the Admiral.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> leaving Duncan sitting in his roadster before
the apartment house, Marjorie had
every intention of slipping into the Portland
through the drug store. Once safely inside the
building she would take refuge in a friend’s apartment
and there fight out her problems alone. The
desire to confide in Duncan, to beg his assistance
was overmastering. She dared not trust herself
longer in his presence. In her doubt and agony, and
longing for his sympathy, she might betray her
passionate love for him. A touch of his hand ...
one look from his dear eyes.... Marjorie
resolutely kept her face turned toward her goal.
Duncan’s affection for his sister was deep and abiding
... he would never believe evil of Janet.</p>

<p>Marjorie strangled a sob as she stumbled into the
drug store, and for a second she struggled gamely
for composure, but the close atmosphere of the
room combined with her overstrung state, upset her
completely. She stepped appealingly toward the
clerk to ask him for a glass of water, but he was
busy with some drugs and did not observe her half-fainting
condition. Swinging dizzily about, she made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>blindly for the door, her one instinct to get away
from Duncan. With her last remaining strength
she pulled open the heavy door and stepped outside.
The cold fresh air revived her somewhat, but her
confusion of mind was added to by discovering she
was standing in busy Fourteenth Street instead of the
quiet lobby of the apartment-hotel. She had walked
out of the wrong door. Before she could retrace her
footsteps, Chichester Barnard stepped to her side.</p>

<p>“What good fairy sent you here?” he exclaimed
gaily. “I was just going back to my office.” His
smile was very winning, but Marjorie was too spent
to attempt reply. Her silence claimed his attention,
and his startled eyes swept her livid face in consternation.
“Good Heavens! Marjorie, what are you
doing in the street in this condition?” he turned and
hailed a livery carriage from which a passenger had
just alighted. “Engaged?” he inquired of the negro
driver.</p>

<p>“No, suh.”</p>

<p>“Jump in, Marjorie,” but she hung back, striving
to articulate, then the world turned black, and she
hung limp upon his arm.</p>

<p>Some hours later Marjorie stirred, sat more erect,
and rubbed her eyes and forehead vigorously. The
shadows of the late afternoon were lengthening, and
she had some difficulty in focusing the objects about
her, and eyed her unfamiliar surroundings in complete
mystification.</p>

<p>“Feeling better, Marjorie?” asked Barnard’s
voice from the depths of an easy chair across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>room from her, and he rose and switched on the
electric lamp.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where&mdash;am I?” she demanded. Not
pausing for an answer she picked up a tumbler of
cold water standing on a table at her elbow, and
drank thirstily. Her throat felt parched and dry.</p>

<p>“In my rooms,” replied Barnard easily. The
tumbler slipped and broke on the polished floor, as
Marjorie faced him.</p>

<p>“How dare you bring me here? Have you no
regard for my reputation?” He changed color at
her tone and words, but curbed his own temper admirably.</p>

<p>“In bringing you here I forgot everyone but the
person for whom <i>you</i> show the greatest consideration&mdash;Madame
Yvonett,” he replied gently, and a
low cry escaped her. “How could I take you to your
home looking more dead than alive? The shock
might have killed your aunt.”</p>

<p>“I had not thought of that,” she conceded. “I
have a dim recollection of driving on and on.”</p>

<p>“So we did. I put you in the cab intending to go
at once to your home; then a glimpse of your face
convinced me that while you looked frightfully ill,
you were really only suffering from collapse. I told
the coachman to drive up and down the back streets,
forced you to drink a little whiskey which I had in
my flask, and that, and the cold wind, gradually
brought you around. These rooms of mine are on
the ground floor, and I slipped you in here unnoticed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Marjorie studied him covertly as the events of the
morning slowly recurred to her. Had he been in the
Fordyce house when Janet testified before the Calhoun-Coopers
and Mr. Fordyce that she had seen
her steal the pearl necklace?</p>

<p>“Why did you not take me back to the Fordyces?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“That occurred to me,” admitted Barnard, “but
to be quite frank I thought that your arriving there
with me in the condition you were in would cause
adverse criticism. The same consideration deterred
me from taking you to a hospital.”</p>

<p>“I see,” slowly. “Perhaps you acted for the best,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I may not have been wise,” he broke in, “but
I was greatly alarmed. I at first feared that you
were dead as you lay there in the carriage. At the
thought my whole world crumbled to dust,” his voice
vibrated with emotion. “I never realized how much
you were to me until I thought I had lost you....”
he faltered and broke down, moved beyond himself
by his passion. He dropped on his knee beside her&mdash;“Best
beloved!”</p>

<p>She shrank back under his touch. “Don’t, don’t
Chichester,” she implored. “I am not strong enough
for more scenes,” and hysterical sobs wracked her
from head to foot. Barnard stood up and watched
her in growing concern until she regained some
semblance of self-control. “It’s a relief to cry,”
she stammered.</p>

<p>“My own sweetheart,” he murmured fondly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>“Would to heaven I could bear your sorrows for
you. Won’t you tell me what is troubling you?”</p>

<p>Marjorie paused; would Barnard take her word
against Janet’s? Her loyal trust in him had made
her at first slow to believe he was seriously courting
Janet, but once convinced of his double dealing, indignation
and contempt had supplanted all warmer
feeling for him. Barnard still kept up the pretense of
his affection for her, but was it likely he would take
her part against Janet? She rose and moved unsteadily
across the room that she might get a better
look at him, and study his expression.</p>

<p>“Sit, here, Marjorie,” Barnard patted the sofa
invitingly, but she declined, and he stepped to her
side. “How often have I pictured you here,” he
said softly, glancing about the comfortable room.
“Little girl, I long for you always.”</p>

<p>“Don’t Chichester,” she threw out her hand beseechingly.
“Drop this sham&mdash;be honest with
me....”</p>

<p>“You doubt me?” in hurt surprise. “You, my
darling, for whom I would sacrifice so much to win!”</p>

<p>“All that is past....”</p>

<p>“It is not,” he broke in vehemently. “I have
learned my lesson this afternoon; I shall never give
you up, never.” He spoke as if making an unalterable
vow with himself, and she watched him uneasily.
“Give me a little encouragement, take back your
harsh words,” he whispered and with a movement
so swift that she could not avoid it, he slipped his
arm about her waist. Swayed by his physical charm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>she permitted him to draw her closer, but before his
lips touched hers, Duncan’s face leaped out of the
shadows of memory, and she pushed Barnard from
her.</p>

<p>“Stop!” In her endeavor to render her voice
steady, she made it hard. “I am in no mood for love
scenes, Chichester.”</p>

<p>A gleam of fury lighted Barnard’s eyes as he
seized her arm.</p>

<p>“Has Duncan Fordyce come between us?” he
demanded. “Answer!”</p>

<p>“Have you lost your senses?” Her cold fury
matched his blazing wrath. “I took you for a gentleman;
no gentleman browbeats a woman!”</p>

<p>“Will you answer my question?” paying no attention
to her gibe.</p>

<p>“What if I say yes?” Marjorie had seldom looked
so beautiful; cheeks pink and eyes bright with feverish
excitement. Tall and slim and graceful, she
faced the jealous man with undaunted spirit.</p>

<p>“If I thought you meant it&mdash;&mdash;?” Barnard’s
husky whisper barely reached her ears, but his look
of agony smote her, angry as she was.</p>

<p>“Are you the only one who can&mdash;flirt?” she asked,
half drawn by his personal magnetism, and half
repelled by his manner.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” eagerly. “Are you merely trying
to tease me? Oh, it <i>must</i> be that”&mdash;answering his
own impetuous question in his anxiety to trample
down his doubts. “A girl must love a man when she
steals for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>Marjorie stood frozen; every vestige of color
stricken from her face. “Explain your meaning.”
The words were little more than a whisper.</p>

<p>“You destroyed the signed codicil in which Aunt
Margaret Lawrence revoked her bequest to me....”</p>

<p>“Chichester!” Her voice was poignant with outraged
feeling. “You dare to think me a thief!”</p>

<p>“No, no, my darling, only a loyal woman&mdash;a
woman who has the courage of her affections&mdash;how
I love you, Marjorie!” His voice lingered on her
name.</p>

<p>“How you insult me, you mean!” With a violent
wrench Marjorie tore herself free from his
grasp, and turning, gathered up her belongings. “Let
me pass,” as he planted himself in front of her.</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“That is no longer your business.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I won’t let you go?”</p>

<p>Marjorie flinched; it was a new Barnard confronting
her. Gone was the suave courtly lover, and in
his place stood the primeval man, his baser passions
roused. And she had once believed she cared for
him. The thought stung.</p>

<p>“Drop this melodrama, Chichester,” she said cuttingly.
“Your conduct has effectually killed whatever
affection or respect I had for you.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong; I have been too patient with your
whims and fancies. Hereafter I take what I want.”
Barnard laughed recklessly. “Women do not
usually refuse me; they like masters.”</p>

<p>“Do not class me with your associates,” she answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
with scornful emphasis. “If you come any
nearer me, Chichester, I shall scream for help.”</p>

<p>“And your reputation will be ruined if you are
found here with me,” mockingly. “Think it over.”
She remained silent. “Is it worth the risk?”</p>

<p>“Risk? I am not hesitating on that score,”
proudly.</p>

<p>“I forgot your family motto, ‘<i>Toujours sans
tache</i>’,” he taunted.</p>

<p>“And no bar sinister,” she said, glancing significantly
at the coat-of-arms hanging above the mantel.
Barnard winced, she had touched the vulnerable
point in his family history; a history of which he was
inordinately proud except for that single blemish.
He threw out his hands imploringly.</p>

<p>“Think, my darling, before it is too late; can you
afford to break with me?”</p>

<p>“I fail to understand you,” she retorted hotly.
“Our so-called engagement was at an end days ago;
I have repeatedly returned your ring....”</p>

<p>“I decline to accept your refusal,” with forced
calmness, and his expression altered. “Marjorie,
I have been mad! Forget all that I have said; remember
only that I love you and you alone. Take
back my ring, my darling.”</p>

<p>“No, never!” she shrank away as he offered it
to her. “I <i>will</i> go!”</p>

<p>Barnard stepped instantly aside. “I implore your
forgiveness,” he pleaded desperately. “I deserve
all the harsh things you said of me, dear; but you
have never truly loved”&mdash;Marjorie’s face changed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>ever so slightly, and she avoided his gaze&mdash;“you
have never loved,” he repeated stubbornly, “never
known what it is to be tempted. Give me a chance
to win back your good opinion; it is all that I ask&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>“It is useless;” Marjorie walked over to the door
leading to the outer hall, and from that safe haven,
turned and faced him. “I never wish to see you
again,” she announced with passionate fervor, and
opening the door, dashed into the hall.</p>

<p>Barnard started to follow her, then thinking better
of it, returned to his seat on the sofa and gazed
blankly about the room. It seemed strangely empty
without Marjorie, and cursing his lack of self-control
and temper which had frightened her away, he picked
up a letter lying on the table which had escaped his
earlier notice. It proved to be a curt note from Alvord
and Alvord informing him that Rear Admiral
Lawrence had brought suit to break his wife’s will.
For a long time Barnard sat inarticulate with rage;
two stumbling blocks were in his way to winning
Marjorie for his wife; one, of his own making, and
the other, a law contest. With settled determination
to win both he picked up the evening paper and
began to read it.</p>

<p>Once in the street Marjorie set out in the direction
of Washington but she was so unutterably exhausted
by all that she had gone through, that her footsteps
lagged and her progress was slow. She was not very
familiar with Georgetown, but had a general idea
of the direction she should take, and keeping an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>outlook for a passing cab, she staggered rather than
walked along, her heart filled with bitter and hopeless
anguish. She had kept the faith and had been
loyal to her benefactress, but when the guilt of others
had been fastened upon her shoulders not one friend
had believed in her innocence. She had still to face
Madame Yvonett. She shivered involuntarily,
paused, walked on, paused again, then turned and
staggered off in the direction of the Potomac River.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HEARING EAR</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>anet</span>, coming swiftly along the hall toward
her mother’s bedroom, met a white-capped
nurse advancing toward her.</p>

<p>“How is mother?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Resting more easily now, Miss Fordyce; the
medicine gave her almost immediate relief.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!” Janet moved forward a few
steps intending to enter her mother’s bedroom, but
the nurse detained her.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon; your brother and Dr. Potter
are with Mrs. Fordyce just now. Seeing so many
together might overexcite her. Could you not come
in a little later?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” but Janet looked troubled. “You
are sure she is better, nurse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” with a reassuring smile.</p>

<p>“Then please ask my brother and Dr. Potter to
stop in the Chinese room when they leave mother.
I would like to talk to them privately before our
guests arrive for dinner.”</p>

<p>“I will tell them,” promised the nurse, and turned
to go.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” Janet gazed perplexedly at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>pretty woman standing just under the hall light.
“Haven’t I seen you before?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Miss Fordyce,” Kathryn Allen’s
smile was most engaging. “I am sure I should not
have forgotten.” And the subtle admiration of
Janet’s good looks and pretty gown conveyed by
her intonation, caused the young girl to flush warmly.
“Do not distress yourself on your mother’s account;
Dr. Potter and Dr. McLane both declare her
attack comes from overexertion. Rest and absolute
quiet are all that she needs to effect a complete
recovery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, nurse,” and Janet, much relieved,
ran down the staircase.</p>

<p>A disagreeable smile spoiled Kathryn Allen’s good
looks as she watched Janet disappear from view;
then with an impatient sigh, she continued her interrupted
trip down the hall toward the bedroom which
had been assigned to her. As she reached the elevator
shaft the door opened and a man stepped out
into the hall.</p>

<p>“You, Joe!” Though startled out of her usual
calm, Kathryn was careful to keep her voice lowered.
“What are you doing here? How dare you take
such a risk?”</p>

<p>“The risk is small,” he answered cautiously. “I
pushed the wrong button and never discovered my
mistake until the lift stopped at this floor,” a satisfied
smile completed the short explanation. “I had
to see you, Kathryn. Why did you come here?”</p>

<p>“I gave up my other case yesterday, as you know,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>tartly. “I can’t afford to be idle. At the hospital
I found Dr. McLane’s call for a nurse to take a
light case, and came here. Money is money, dear
boy.” She did not think it necessary to add that she
had considered the opportunity of becoming an inmate
of the Fordyce household a God-given chance.</p>

<p>“You should have consulted me first,” fumed Joe,
displeased at the lightness of her manner. “I only
found out by chance from McLane that you were
here. Have you seen the evening paper?”</p>

<p>The urgency of his tone impressed her. From
above came the sound of advancing footsteps.</p>

<p>“Quick, this way,” she muttered, and pulled him
into the deep shadows afforded by a bow window and
its curtains.</p>

<p>Downstairs in the Chinese room Janet waited
for her brother and Paul Potter with ever growing
impatience. The thick soft carpet deadened the
sound of her restless trampling back and forth. She
could not keep still. She fingered the rich oriental
hangings, scanned the valuable jade and carved
ivory ornaments in the glass cabinets; then turned
her attention to the collection of Chinese armor occupying
its allotted space, and traced with curious
fingers the beautiful handiwork on the scabbards
and daggers and carefully inspected the naked blades
themselves. The atmosphere of the room was heavy
with the incense of the East. Mrs. Fordyce had
selected the room as her own private sanctum in
preference to the larger library, and spent all her
evenings there in the absence of Janet and Duncan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>Her fondness for things oriental had been indulged
by her husband, who had spent a small fortune collecting
costly furniture, curios, paintings, and silks
from China to gratify her whim.</p>

<p>Tired of contemplating the armor Janet stepped
over to the inlaid teakwood desk, and seating herself
before it, idly opened one of the numerous magazines
which her mother had left there. Suddenly
her attention was arrested by a photograph of Tom
Nichols, and she turned eagerly to the printed page,
to find that the article was descriptive of Fort Myer
and other army posts. She took a second look at
Tom’s picture. It was a good likeness. Janet’s
eyes grew very tender, and impulsively she stooped
and kissed the picture. She jerked herself erect as
the hall door opened, and a hot blush dyed her
cheeks, but the question on her lips remained
unspoken. Marjorie Langdon was confronting
her.</p>

<p>Shutting the door softly behind her, Marjorie
advanced into the room and quietly seated herself
opposite Janet. The contrast between the two girls
was noticeable in the extreme. Janet made a dainty
picture of fresh young beauty in her perfectly fitting,
expensive low-neck evening dress, while Marjorie,
her white crêpe de chine waist and walking skirt
covered by a heavy driving coat and minus her hat,
looked spent and weary. She had aged in the last
few tortured hours, and the hands she rested on the
flat-top desk were trembling from fatigue and nervousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“You?” Janet’s agitation was perceptible in her
voice and manner. “What&mdash;what do you want?
What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I came, Janet, hoping that you had thought better
of your extraordinary behavior to me this morning,”
answered Marjorie looking quietly at her, but Janet
did not flinch before her direct gaze.</p>

<p>“Don’t make things harder for me, Marjorie,”
she said sadly. “I was&mdash;we all were&mdash;very fond of
you; why did you abuse our trust? Mother would
gladly have helped you out of any pressing money
difficulties.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s incredulous stare deepened suddenly
into horror.</p>

<p>“Janet! Janet!” she gasped. “Does your moral
obliquity blind you to all sense of honor?”</p>

<p>Janet stiffened and her manner hardened. “You
forget yourself.”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s hardly tried self-control snapped, and
leaning back in her chair she gave way to wild
laughter which ended in sobs. Janet regarded her
in increasing alarm.</p>

<p>“Go! Go at once!” she ordered.</p>

<p>The sharp command restored Marjorie to some
semblance of composure. “No, I shall not go,” she
said more quietly. “You are right, Janet, I have
forgotten myself&mdash;to an absurd extent; but I’ll do
so no longer. Your father shall learn the truth tonight.”</p>

<p>“He will turn you out of the house as a common
adventuress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Marjorie leaned across the desk and contemplated
Janet in silence.</p>

<p>“Janet,” she began at length. “I have never
shown you anything but kindness; I have tried in
every way to see that you had a good time and were
enjoying yourself. In Heaven’s name, what has
aroused your animosity? Why should you hound
me in this manner?”</p>

<p>“I’m not hounding you,” protested Janet, tears
springing to her eyes. “I have tried very hard to
blind myself to your&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My what?” a dangerous light in her eyes.</p>

<p>But Janet dodged the question. “You must go,”
she said, her words tumbling over each other in her
haste. “My guests will arrive here in a few minutes.
Pauline must not find you here&mdash;there will be another
scene&mdash;&mdash;” Janet fairly wrung her hands&mdash;“People
will talk so.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, they will,” but the significant emphasis
passed completely over Janet’s head. “I have no
objection to confronting Pauline again, and particularly
do I wish to see Tom Nichols.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed; and what do you wish to see him
about?”</p>

<p>“I desire his advice,” calmly. “I started to go to
Fort Myer this afternoon and got as far as the
Aqueduct Bridge in Georgetown when I recollected
he was to dine here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so decided to come here yourself,” Janet
laughed recklessly. “Your motives are not so pure
as you would lead me to suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>“Stop!” Marjorie’s imperious tone made even the
jealous girl pause. “I think you have taken leave of
your senses.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome to your opinion,” retorted
Janet defiantly. “But I insist on your leaving this
house. Do you wish to be turned out again?”</p>

<p>“I have never been turned out.” Marjorie was
struggling to keep her temper within bounds. “I
left this house of my own accord this morning. My
clothes are still here, and here I shall remain until
I am dismissed by your mother.”</p>

<p>Janet’s eyes were dark with passion. “You dare
to stay on as my chaperon?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Your behavior to me tonight has made
me reconsider my quixotic effort to shield you; from
now on I shall strive to clear myself of your lying
testimony against me.”</p>

<p>“You leave me but one alternative....”</p>

<p>“And that is&mdash;&mdash;?” as Janet paused.</p>

<p>“To have the servants put you out of the house.”</p>

<p>“Janet!” Marjorie gazed at the young girl in
stupefaction, and the latter’s eyes wavered and fell
as she caught the keen reproach and pain which
Marjorie’s face betrayed. For a second she battled
with her better self.</p>

<p>“I will give you just three minutes to leave this
room and house of your own accord,” she said
clearly. “At the end of that time I shall ring for the
servants.” And she picked up the hammer belonging
to the beautiful Chinese gong which her mother
used to summon her maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>In the stillness the ticking of the dock on the desk
was plainly audible. Slowly, very slowly Marjorie
rose and walked with deliberation over to the door
opening on the private staircase which led to Mrs.
Fordyce’s suite of rooms on the floor above. Janet
followed her movements with distended eyes; then
the chamois-covered hammer in her hand rose and
fell, stroke on stroke, until the room vibrated with
the mellow tones of the Chinese gong.</p>

<p>Out in the wide hall a man, partly concealed by
the heavy portières, jumped nervously back from the
keyhole of the door as the sound of the gong reached
him, and turning, scuddled down the hall just as Dr.
Paul Potter came down the broad winding staircase.
The latter paused as the clear bell-like vibrations of
the gong drifted to his ears, bringing with them a
note of urgency and appeal which he was quick to
answer.</p>

<p>Locating the sound, he made for the Chinese
room and rapped sharply on the panels of the closed
door. He waited an appreciable instant, then, receiving
no response, turned the knob and walked
into the room. As he crossed the threshold his foot
struck a small object and sent it spinning ahead of
him. His eyes followed the bright silver, and he was
about to advance and pick up the pencil when, looking
up, he spied Janet sitting in front of the desk.
Her attitude arrested his attention. Crossing the
intervening space at a bound, he felt her pulse and
heart; then stepped back, and his keen gaze swept
the room. Convinced that they were alone, he again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>bent over her and laid his hand lightly on her bare
neck.</p>

<p>“Feeling better?” he inquired some moments
later.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Janet shivered and pulled her scarf up
about her shoulders. “The incense here always
makes me feel deadly faint. I don’t see how mother
stands it.”</p>

<p>“It is trying; suppose I open the window,” moving
toward it.</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” she shivered again. “I am quite
cold enough already. I would like a glass of water,”
pointing to a carafe and tumblers standing on a small
table near the window. Potter quickly got it for her
and watched the warm color return gradually into
her pale cheeks. “That tastes so good. You kept
me waiting an awfully long time, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry; your father and I were reminiscing.
I thought Duncan was here with you.”</p>

<p>“Duncan here?” He wondered at the alarm in
her tone. “No, he hasn’t been near me. How is
mother?”</p>

<p>“Very much improved.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” in a relieved voice. “I felt such
a pig to have the dinner tonight, but mother positively
refused to let me call it off. Father said it
was better to humor her.”</p>

<p>“He’s quite right; your mother must not be excited
by discussions or dissensions.”</p>

<p>“We never have them,” she laughed saucily. “We
are a united family ruled by mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>“I have a great regard for Mrs. Fordyce,” replied
Potter gravely, not liking her flippant tone.</p>

<p>“Have you just come from her room?”</p>

<p>“No, your father and I were talking in the boudoir.”</p>

<p>“Did you see&mdash;&mdash;” a knock on the hall door interrupted
her. “Come in.”</p>

<p>“Miss Swann is in the drawing-room, Miss Janet,”
announced the footman.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I must run,” Janet gathered up her
scarf, fan, and handkerchief. “If you see Duncan,
Doctor, please ask him to hurry,” and she departed.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her Potter walked over
and picked up the silver pencil. He was still examining
it when Duncan entered the room.</p>

<p>“Where’s Janet?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Gone into the drawing-room,” Potter slipped the
silver pencil inside his white waistcoat pocket.
“Whom do the initials ‘J. C. C.’ stand for?”</p>

<p>“‘J. C. C.’,” echoed Duncan reflectively. “Let
me see. Oh, I guess J. Calhoun-Cooper.”</p>

<p>“A friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“An acquaintance,” shortly. “His sister was at
Madame Yvonett’s this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Potter’s fingers sought the lobe of his
right ear. “I believe you said they were dining here
tonight.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I asked Janet to recall their invitations,
but she refused to do so.”</p>

<p>“Quite right; unless you wish to declare war on
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>“I’m willing to do it,” Duncan scowled savagely.
“The way Pauline dared to address Madame
Yvonett made my blood boil. Janet promised to see
that I did not sit next to her. Joe, Pauline’s brother,
made a mistake in the dinner hour and arrived here
some time ago; he sent word to me by Henderson not
to hurry, he’d wait in the billiard-room. The poor
fool must be tired of knocking the balls about by
himself.”</p>

<p>Potter looked irresolutely at Duncan, but before
he could make up his mind to a definite course, the
telephone bell in the library across the hall rang
insistently, and with a hasty word of excuse Duncan
dashed to answer it. Picking up the evening paper
from the chair where Janet had dropped it, Potter
read it hurriedly while awaiting Duncan’s return.</p>

<p>“Come on in the drawing-room, Paul,” called the
latter from the doorway a few minutes later. “Janet
has sent a hurry call for us,” and as he joined him
the physician saw the butler’s broad back disappearing
in the distance.</p>

<p>“Any news from Madame Yvonett?” he asked, as
they started for the ballroom.</p>

<p>“Miss Graves has just telephoned no word has
been received from Marjorie,” Duncan looked as
anxious as he felt. “I wish to heaven she was here.”</p>

<p>“So do I; not only on your account, Duncan, but
to settle one point once for all,” the physician
paused doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?” growled Duncan.</p>

<p>“Your father has just told me that he has purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
the famous Maharajah ruby, and now has it
in his possession....”</p>

<p>“Yes, he bought it to give to mother on their wedding
anniversary tomorrow; goodness knows why
she hates ostentatious display in jewels as in everything
else.”</p>

<p>“Has your father spoken of his intention to buy
the ruby?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Um!” A dry smile twisted Potter’s lips. “The
jeweler who conducted the sale must have talked.
The evening paper gives a full account of your
father’s valuable purchase, and a description of the
ruby. Now, if only Miss Langdon were here we
would soon find out how disinterested are her thieving
propensities.”</p>

<p>“I have a great mind to punch your head!” said
Duncan furiously. “Heaven only knows where the
poor girl is tonight; and you stand there and dare
insinuate&mdash;&mdash; Oh, come into the drawing-room and
meet&mdash;&mdash;” his voice died in his throat.</p>

<p>Standing receiving the guests, looking extremely
beautiful in her low-cut evening dress, was Marjorie
Langdon.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arjorie</span> saw them at the same instant and
for a second faltered, then stepped quietly
forward to meet them.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” she said. “Janet, here are the
truants. I think you are to take me out to dinner,
Dr. Potter,” and the hand she placed on the physician’s
arm was steady.</p>

<p>Duncan, collecting his scattered wits, offered his
arm to the pretty girl Janet had assigned to him, and
followed the others out to the dining-room. Judging
from appearances his father and Janet had accepted
Marjorie’s return without audible comment.
Janet, confused by the rapid trend of events, had
quickly decided to let well enough alone. She feared
to precipitate a disastrous scene if she asked Marjorie
to withdraw. Her father, a complete man of
the world, had quickly made up his mind to accept
the situation, and postponed questioning Marjorie
as to her disappearance and return until after the
dinner was over.</p>

<p>Inwardly cursing his luck that he was not seated
next to Marjorie so that he could question her and
tell her of his discovery as to how the Lawrence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>codicil was lost, Duncan took the chair next his companion
with an ill grace. There was some confusion
in seating the guests, owing to Janet’s having
changed her father’s accustomed seat at the end to
one side of the long table. Paul Potter seized the
opportunity to draw his host to one side.</p>

<p>“Has Janet had any return of&mdash;&mdash;” he lowered
his voice discreetly&mdash;&mdash;“of the old trouble about which
you consulted me when she was at boarding-school?”</p>

<p>Fordyce started. “Not to my knowledge,” he
whispered. “What do you....” But Potter
had slipped into his chair between Janet and Marjorie,
and cogitating deeply, Fordyce made his way
to his own place.</p>

<p>Leisurely unfolding his napkin, Potter looked with
interest about the table.</p>

<p>“Take pity on a stranger, Miss Langdon, and tell
me the names of my fellow guests,” he said. “I
came into the drawing-room too late to meet them.”</p>

<p>“Captain Nichols is on Janet’s right; next to him
is Miss Pauline Calhoun-Cooper; the girl on Mr.
Calderon Fordyce’s right is Miss Swann, of Baltimore.
Isn’t she pretty?” added Marjorie. “The
others are Miss Marsh, Miss Dodge, and my neighbor
here, Mr. Calhoun-Cooper,” indicating Joe with
a motion of her hand.</p>

<p>“You have skipped the man sitting opposite you,”
prompted Potter. The table, a recent purchase of Mr.
Fordyce’s who never tired of haunting antique shops,
was wide enough to permit two seats being placed
side by side at either end, and as Marjorie’s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>traveled down the long expanse of damask and its load
of silver and glass she encountered Barnard’s fixed
stare. She acknowledged his low bow with a slight
inclination of her head, and turned again to Potter.</p>

<p>“Chichester Barnard,” she said briefly. “Have you
met Mr. Calhoun-Cooper, Dr. Potter,” she added as
Joe, catching his name, wheeled toward her and
through several courses the two men talked with her.</p>

<p>Janet absorbed Tom Nichols’ attention to the exclusion
of others, and Pauline Calhoun-Cooper, who
also had much to occupy her thoughts, gave up trying
to make conversation with Mr. Calderon Fordyce
and sat back in her chair and watched Marjorie.
She had heard through Janet of Marjorie’s departure
that morning, and Madame Yvonett’s statement
that her niece had not returned home had convinced
Pauline that, as she vulgarly put it, Marjorie
had made a “quick get-away.” She was at a loss to
understand why the Fordyces championed Marjorie’s
cause. That they did so, she never doubted; Marjorie’s
very presence indicated that fact. On discovering
Marjorie in the drawing-room, Pauline,
considering it a personal affront that a girl whom
she charged with being an ordinary thief should be
an honored guest under the same roof with her, had
confided to Joe that she was leaving immediately and
he was to accompany her. But Joe, for once obdurate
to his sister’s commands and entreaties, roughly refused
to budge, and inwardly furious, she had made
the best of the awkward situation and remained also.
With exemplary patience she bided her time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>Janet’s feverishly gay chatter gave Tom Nichols
little opportunity to broach a serious topic. He was
deeply puzzled and perturbed over the loss and
return of the bracelet to the Calhoun-Coopers, and
the theft of Mrs. Calhoun-Cooper’s pearl necklace
had added to his bewilderment. He had spent the
past twenty-four hours trying to unravel the mystery.
While Janet had not said in so many words, that
the bracelet was hers, her manner had clearly indicated
that fact. Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper
claimed the bracelet as his, and it had been returned
to him. Janet’s special delivery note hinted broadly
that Marjorie had received the bracelet after he
left it at her house. And yet how did Marjorie know
Janet was wearing a bracelet which belonged to J.
Calhoun-Cooper, and why did she return it anonymously
to the Representative without first mentioning
her intentions to Janet? Tom shrank from the
answer which reason dictated.</p>

<p>“Why so solemn?” challenged Janet, not getting
an immediate answer to her former question. All
through the dinner she had carefully refrained from
glancing in Barnard’s direction. Under the stimulus of
Tom’s presence, she had cast prudence to the winds.</p>

<p>“Solemn? Far from it; a nonsense rhyme is
bothering me to death. I wonder if you can tell me
where it came from,” and he quoted hurriedly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I gave her one, they gave him two</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You gave us three or more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They all returned from him to you</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though they were mine before.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“Alice In Wonderland!” Janet clapped her
hands and laughed in open amusement. “To think
of an artillery officer being ‘up’ in nursery rhymes.”</p>

<p>“So that’s where the lines are from! My niece
and nephew are responsible for my knowledge of
Lewis Carroll’s masterpiece.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the next verse?” asked Janet.
“It goes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘If I or she should chance to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Involved in this affair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I trust to you to set me free</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Exactly as we were.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tom had a retentive memory. Was Janet intentionally
misquoting? Did she mean him to take
the nonsense rhyme seriously? He glanced sharply
at her, but her head was partly turned as she helped
herself to the <i>vol-au-vent</i>. He waited for her full
attention before answering.</p>

<p>“It sounds like the unutterable tread of unsearchable
circumstances,” he said.</p>

<p>It was Janet’s turn to be mystified. “I don’t at
all understand what you mean,” she admitted
plaintively, wrinkling her pretty forehead in wonder.
“I don’t even know you are really my friend....”</p>

<p>“Janet, don’t for a moment doubt me,” Tom
lowered his voice so that it reached her ear alone.
“I am yours, heart and soul.”</p>

<p>Her eyes fell before his, unable to bear the worship
which kindled his plain features almost into
beauty, and the carmine mounted her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll never believe anything people may say
against me?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“Never,” with reassuring vehemence.</p>

<p>“Will you promise to stand by me&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Always; through thick and thin.”</p>

<p>“Then, Tom, save me from myself,” and a little
cold hand slipped into his under cover of the table.</p>

<p>Tom was white under his tan. He was in deadly
earnest, but was Janet equally so? His clasp
tightened on her hand until her ring cut into the
tender flesh.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Janet,” and the very repression of his
voice showed the tension he was laboring under.
“Is there a chance for me?”</p>

<p>“You are very blind, dear,” and the love-light in
her eyes was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Paul Potter scanned Janet and Tom quizzically
for a second, then turned back to Marjorie.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he said. “I’ve tried repeatedly to
break into their conversation; but it’s a close corporation.
Behold, you still have me on your hands.”</p>

<p>“That is no hardship but good fortune,” Marjorie
spoke with truthfulness. Joe was not particularly
interesting at any time; and feeling as she did
that night, anything which interrupted a tête-à-tête
with a member of the Calhoun-Cooper family was
in the nature of a relief. She had held a three-cornered
conversation with Potter and Joe most of
the evening, and Joe, usually unobserving, had not
failed to note the physician’s intent gaze and finally
turning restive under the ceaseless espionage, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>glad to present his back to his right-hand neighbors
and talk to his dinner partner, Miss Dodge.</p>

<p>“Tell me more of your adventures when you
accompanied Duncan Fordyce to China, Doctor,”
continued Marjorie, after a short pause.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve already related all the exciting
incidents of our trip. If you want thrilling romance
ask Mr. Fordyce to tell you the story of the Maharajah’s
ruby which he intends giving to his wife on their
wedding anniversary tomorrow. Has he already
shown it to you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, he only purchased the ruby today.
I believe I’m letting out state secrets,” Potter laughed
ruefully. “Don’t betray me, even to Janet.”</p>

<p>“I promise not to, but....”</p>

<p>“Are you and Marjorie speaking of the ruby?”
questioned Janet. Pauline had finally interrupted
her conversation with Tom by claiming the latter’s
undivided attention, and Janet had overheard Potter’s
remarks. “That’s no secret, Doctor; it is in the
evening papers. I teased father to show it to me
just before you came in”&mdash;Marjorie’s heart sank
like lead with forebodings of more trouble. “It’s
the most beautiful stone I’ve ever seen,” went on
Janet enthusiastically. “A real pigeon-blood ruby.
I could hardly put it down.”</p>

<p>Marjorie lost Potter’s reply; her attention being
centered on Perkins. The butler was bending over
and speaking confidentially to Mr. Calderon
Fordyce. As the whispered colloquy progressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>Calderon Fordyce’s face grew set and stern. With
a quiet word of apology to the two girls sitting on
either side of him, he pushed back his chair and
left the room.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Mrs. Fordyce is worse, Doctor?”
questioned Marjorie.</p>

<p>Potter looked troubled as he beckoned to Perkins.
“Does Mr. Fordyce wish me to go to his wife?” he
inquired, as the butler stopped behind him.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mr. Fordyce has gone to answer a
telephone message, sir. Champagne, Miss Langdon?”
and before she could stop him, he had refilled
her glass.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Mrs. Fordyce, Doctor?” asked
Marjorie, as Perkins passed on.</p>

<p>“Yes, just before dinner. She seemed immensely
improved.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I could see her later?” She tried
hard to suppress all anxious longing, but it crept into
her voice, and Potter examined her white face with
keen intentness.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be wise,” and Marjorie’s
sensitive nerves quivered under the peculiar intonation
of his voice. Were they all in league to keep
her from confiding her troubles to Mrs. Fordyce,
her one friend?</p>

<p>To Duncan Fordyce the dinner was interminable.
Fortunately the very young girls who had fallen to
his share were so taken up with talking of their affairs
that his part in the conversation sank to monosyllables,
to his great relief. He was not in the mood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>to make small talk. His father had motioned to him
to keep his seat when he rose on receiving Perkins’
message, and much against his will he had done so.
He did not like his father’s expression; it betokened
bad news. His thoughts instantly sped to his mother,
but Perkins’ hurried whisper relieved that anxiety,
and he was just starting to enjoy his untasted salad
when, happening to look down the table, he caught
Marjorie’s eyes. Their expression of dumb despair
stirred him out of himself.</p>

<p>His impulse was to go to her at once, but cooler
counsel prevailed. Such a course would instantly
draw attention to Marjorie; he would not mind, but
she might seriously resent being made conspicuous.
With inward fervor he consigned the cook who invented
long menus to a warm climate; the table had
to be cleared and the ices served before he would be
free to go to Marjorie. He glanced at his neighbors:
Miss Marsh was holding an animated three-cornered
conversation with Chichester Barnard and
Miss Swann, and Miss Dodge, on his left, was deeply
engrossed with Joe Calhoun-Cooper. He was the
only person at the table not busily talking. Taking
up his place card and drawing out a gold pencil, he
wrote a few lines under cover of the table, and
beckoning to Perkins, slipped the card inside his hand
with a whispered direction.</p>

<p>A second later Marjorie’s elbow was gently jogged
by Perkins and a card was placed in her lap unseen
by her neighbors. Surprised and somewhat alarmed,
she waited until Potter and Janet were engaged in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>warm argument; then glanced down, and under the
shelter of her napkin read the few words written in
Duncan’s distinctive writing on the back of his place
card:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Marjorie</span>:</p>

<p>I love you. Will you marry me? Answer yes, by raising
your champagne glass.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Duncan.</span></p></div>

<p>Janet turned back again to Tom, and Potter, left
to himself, addressed several remarks to Marjorie.
Not getting any reply, he looked at her in surprise
and discovered her eye-lashes were wet with tears.
Before he could think of anything to say or do, she
glanced up, her face transfigured.</p>

<p>“W&mdash;what did you say?” she stammered. Her
eyes, alight with new-born happiness and hope
traveled past Potter to Duncan. A moment’s hesitation;
then she raised her champagne glass to him,
and Duncan’s blood coursed hotly through his veins
as he pledged her in tender silence across the table.
“I did not catch what you said, Dr. Potter,” she
added softly, her eyes never leaving Duncan’s radiant
face.</p>

<span class="smaller">PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">K</span>athryn Allen</span>, taking care that her
starched white nurse’s uniform made no
crinkling sound, bent over Mrs. Fordyce and
listened to her regular breathing. Satisfied that her
patient was at last asleep, she arranged the night-light,
placed several bottles and glasses on the bedstand,
and left the room. Her rubber-soled shoes
made no sound, and she passed through the empty
rooms and halls in ghostly silence. First, she paid a
lengthy visit to Marjorie’s old room, and when she
emerged into the hall her white gown was covered
by a dark coat-sweater which Mrs. Fordyce had
given to Marjorie at Christmas, and the becoming
white nurse’s cap nestled in one of the pockets of
the sweater. Finally, reaching the drawing-room
floor, she paused to listen to the distant hum of
voices and gay laughter coming faintly from the
dining-room, then she peeped into the ballroom. It
was empty, and the drawing-room likewise.</p>

<p>Convinced that the way was clear she entered the
library and was about to make herself comfortable
in Mr. Fordyce’s own easy-chair, when the sound of
rapidly approaching footsteps startled her, and she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>darted behind the long silken window curtains which
effectually concealed her from view.</p>

<p>The curtains had barely fallen back into place when
the hall door opened and Calderon Fordyce came in
and walked over to the telephone. He was in much
too great a hurry to observe his surroundings
closely, and becoming absorbed in his conversation
over the wire, never heard the faint rustle of the
curtains as Kathryn Allen peered out between them
into the room, drinking in every word she could
overhear. She jerked her head out of sight as Fordyce
hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blessed!” he exclaimed aloud. “I
don’t want any more scenes; where in thunder did
Janet put the evening paper?” But his search was
unavailing, and he left the library still grumbling.</p>

<p>Kathryn allowed several minutes to elapse before
she stirred from behind the curtains. Finally convinced
that Calderon Fordyce was not likely to return
at once, she went directly to his desk, and selecting
pen and paper, scribbled rapidly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Joe</span>,</p>

<p>They know, and have telephoned Calderon Fordyce. Get
a taxi and wait for me around the corner. Don’t fail.</p>

<p class="right">K. A.</p></div>

<p>She reread what she had written, then drawing out
a folded paper from the same pocket which contained
her nurse’s cap, she picked out a long envelope
stamped with Calderon Fordyce’s house address,
and wrote above it Marjorie Langdon’s name; then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>straightening out the folded paper, enclosed it in
the envelope which she sealed and addressed, and
making free with Calderon Fordyce’s stamp-book,
soon had it ready for the mail.</p>

<p>“I think my ‘find’ will square accounts with both
Marjorie Langdon and Chichester Barnard,” she
murmured, with malicious fury. “He won’t marry
me, and he shan’t marry her. God! how I&mdash;I&mdash;love
him”&mdash;and the unhappy woman bowed her head in
anguish. The fact that her habit of self-deception
had magnified Barnard’s attentions to her did not
soften the realization that he cared nothing for her.
It was but another version of the moth and the
flame, and pretty Kathryn, her wings singed, turned
with sore heart to Joe as her haven of refuge. But
even so she could neither forgive Barnard nor forget
him.</p>

<p>Replacing the envelope in her pocket, she rearranged
the displaced desk ornaments, and picking up
the note addressed to Joe, left the room. No one
saw her make her way into the men’s cloakroom on
the ground floor, but once there she stuck Joe’s note
on the mantel in plain view and sped into the hall.
Not wishing to encounter any servant she entered
the lift and shot up to the drawing-room floor. She
made certain the way was clear before venturing
down the hall to the Chinese room. Mrs. Fordyce
had sent her there earlier in the evening to get the
<i>Evening Star</i>, and she had used the private staircase
to go and return. It would be the quickest way to
reach her patient undetected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>But the contents of the Chinese room fascinated
her, and she lingered on, examining with growing
interest the many beautiful curios. So absorbed was
she that she never heard the opening and closing of
the hall door.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho, Kathryn!” said a well-known voice, and
with a stifled cry she faced about.</p>

<p>“Chichester!”</p>

<p>Barnard laughed softly as he observed her confusion.
“Pretty, pretty, Kathryn!” he mocked.
“Why so far from your patient, my dear?”</p>

<p>“What business is that of yours?”</p>

<p>“My general interest in your welfare prompts the
question.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” bitterly. “You have already shown me
that you care nothing for me.”</p>

<p>“Interest does not necessarily mean affection, my
dear Kathryn. You are so emotional you confuse
the terms.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your interest,” she replied sullenly,
her resentment rising.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” with a provoking smile. “Suppose
I lost interest in you and reported your neglect
of Mrs. Fordyce to her husband. Is your reputation
as a reliable nurse of no value to you?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Found a bonanza?”</p>

<p>“No; a man who respects me.”</p>

<p>Barnard laughed again. “Poor fool!”</p>

<p>Kathryn’s cheeks turned as red as her hair as her
smoldering wrath kindled under his look and words.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>“You are the pitiful fool; wasting your love on a
girl who betrays you,” she snapped, and meeting his
blank stare, added: “Marjorie Langdon has other
intentions since being thrown with Duncan Fordyce.
You don’t believe me? Well, I have proof she’s
off with the old love. I found out tonight that she
plans to ruin you.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” but Barnard paled. “I am in no woman’s
power....”</p>

<p>“Then why should Marjorie Langdon write to
Admiral Lawrence?” she supplemented.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t she?” he countered.</p>

<p>“Put it down to a change of heart,” she taunted.
“Perhaps Marjorie wants her old secretaryship back
again, perhaps conscience prompts her to make restitution.
The envelope was long, it could easily have
held a legal document ... for instance, a codicil
to a will.”</p>

<p>“Where did you make this interesting discovery?”</p>

<p>“Among Marjorie’s belongings.”</p>

<p>“While playing hide-and-seek,” he jeered. “Well,
did you leave it there?”</p>

<p>“For you to steal?” The sneer cost her dearly,
for Barnard’s quick wits grasped the situation.</p>

<p>“No, of course you didn’t; an unscrupulous woman
would not leave capital behind. Give it to me.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t it”&mdash;but Barnard, paying no attention
to the denial, sprang toward her. “Stop, you hurt
my arm”&mdash;struggling in his grasp. “You brute!”</p>

<p>“Give me the letter!” Barnard shook her violently.
For answer she sank her teeth in his hand. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>devil!” he gasped, and she reeled backward under
his blow. As her weight fell on the unlatched door
leading to the private staircase, it opened and precipitated
her into the short passage way. In an instant
Barnard was by the fallen woman’s side, but
before he could search her for the letter he supposed
she had, Janet Fordyce stepped into the Chinese
room. The passage way was fortunately dark, and
she did not observe Barnard kneeling by Kathryn.
With a swift movement Barnard pushed the door to,
leaving however, a crack through which he could peer
into the Chinese room.</p>

<p>Humming a gay tune Janet paused by the electric
droplight, then sitting down before the desk she
opened the left-hand drawer and putting in her hand
felt about until her lingers found a spring which she
pressed. Instantly the panel between the two
drawers, which usually looked as solid as the rest
of the desk, flew out, and Janet, bending down
slipped her hand inside the opening and pulled out
a jewel-box. With leisurely movement she opened
the case and held it directly under the lamp, and the
light fell on a superb ruby set as a pendant. She
gazed at it admiringly and taking the jewel out of
the case carefully inspected the exquisite workmanship
of the pendant. She fondled the jewel for a
moment, then replaced it in its case, and laid the latter
back in the secret drawer. But before closing the
drawer she evidently thought better of it and again
lifted out the ruby pendant, replaced the empty case,
closed the drawer, and unhurriedly left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Through the crack of the door Barnard, with eyes
almost starting from his head, watched Janet’s every
movement; so intent was he that he failed to notice
Kathryn. Taking advantage of his absorption, she
had risen to her knees and was also peering into the
Chinese room. As Janet disappeared, she sprang
to her feet, intending to run upstairs, but Barnard
pulled her back and stared at her in horror. She
was shaking with noiseless mirth which threatened to
break out into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>“The girl’s a thief, a common thief,” she gasped
faintly. “Trust you to find it out, and use your
knowledge to bend her to your will. Well, you may
make her your wife, but she loves Tom Nichols.”
She blanched before his furious expression. “I tell
you, Janet Fordyce loves Tom Nichols,” she repeated
stubbornly. “I’ve just read the young fool’s
diary.”</p>

<p>“Your inordinate curiosity will be your ruin,” said
Barnard, with ominous quietness. “Give me the
paper you found in Marjorie Langdon’s room,”
folding his handkerchief around his bruised hand.</p>

<p>“Hush!” A murmur of voices sounded down the
hall, and Kathryn seized on the interruption. “Go
in there,” she directed, “unless you wish to be caught
out here with me.” Barnard hesitated; the voices
were most certainly drawing nearer; it would be one
thing to be found waiting in the Chinese room alone,
and quite a different matter to be discovered apparently
hiding in a back passage with a trained
nurse. He dared not risk another struggle with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>Kathryn, they most certainly would be overheard.
With a muttered oath he laid his hand on the door
knob.</p>

<p>“You send that paper to Admiral Lawrence at
your own peril,” he whispered. “I know of certain
escapades which will forfeit any man’s respect for
you&mdash;you understand. Don’t push me too far,” and
jerking open the door he stepped back into the
Chinese room.</p>

<p>He had been there but a moment when Calderon
Fordyce entered with Representative J. Calhoun-Cooper.
With a hasty word of greeting to the latter,
Barnard backed toward the hall door, eager to be
gone.</p>

<p>“Stop a second, Barnard,” exclaimed Calhoun-Cooper.
“I am glad to have you here. Perhaps you
can help me in a legal way.”</p>

<p>“Anything I can do, sir,” Barnard was careful to
remain in the shadow as much as possible, keeping
his bandaged hand in his pocket. “I am entirely at
your service.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Calhoun-Cooper turned his attention
to his host, to Barnard’s relief. “Have you sent for
Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Fordyce shortly. “Look here,
Cooper, can’t you contrive to settle this affair without
a scene?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. Barnard, here, will help me.” Barnard
looked wonderingly at the two men. “What is the
legal age for marriage in the District, Barnard?”</p>

<p>“With or without the consent of parents?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>“Without.”</p>

<p>Before Barnard could reply, the hall door opened
and Pauline stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“What’s to pay, father?” she inquired. “I saw
you arrive, and overheard the footman tell Joe to
come to this room. Is mother ill?”</p>

<p>“No, go back to the drawing-room, Pauline, and
hurry Joe in here.”</p>

<p>“He won’t come.” Pauline, scenting excitement,
was reluctant to leave.</p>

<p>“Won’t he?” Calhoun-Cooper’s temper was
aroused. Stepping past the others, he jerked open
the hall door just in time to see Joe dash by. “Stop
him!” he commanded. Tom Nichols, who happened
to be returning from the smoking-room, instinctively
tripped up the running man, and not until he helped
him to his feet, did he recognize Joe.</p>

<p>“Go back into that room,” ordered Calhoun-Cooper,
and Joe quailed before the look in his eyes.
“Come with us, Nichols; no, there’s no use trying
to run away again,” as Joe made a sideways motion
to duck by them.</p>

<p>Much astounded Tom followed the father and
son into the Chinese room. Janet, getting out of
the elevator, saw the little procession, and moved
by curiosity, also entered the room. Calderon Fordyce
glanced vexedly at the increasing group around
him, his request that there should be no scene was
not to be granted. Calhoun-Cooper was about to
speak when Duncan opened the hall door.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by running off and leaving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>your guests, Janet?” he demanded. “They are saying
good-bye, and Marjorie....” he stopped
abruptly as his eyes fell on the others. “Go back to
the drawing-room, dear,” and he pushed Janet
through the door and closed it behind her.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth, Joe,” commanded Calhoun-Cooper.
“Have you taken out a marriage license?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joe sullenly.</p>

<p>“What?” screamed Pauline. “Who are you going
to marry?”</p>

<p>“None of your business,” retorted her brother.</p>

<p>“It is very much my business,” broke in Calhoun-Cooper,
who had been holding a hurried conversation
with Barnard. “Considering you are not of
legal age to marry in the District without your
parent’s consent.”</p>

<p>“We can be married in Rockville,” replied Joe
heatedly. “I suppose you read the marriage license
published in the <i>Star</i> tonight.”</p>

<p>“Your mother read it after dinner, and at once
notified me at the Capitol.”</p>

<p>“It’s rotten luck!” complained Joe bitterly. “I
didn’t know they’d publish it. Why should you withhold
your consent, father? Kathryn Allen is worthy
of respect and love.”</p>

<p>“Kathryn Allen!” Pauline’s face turned red with
mortification and rage. “You propose marrying that
girl of questionable repute? You dare to think of
bringing her into our family!”</p>

<p>“My family is quite as good as yours,” retorted a
voice from the other side of the room, and Kathryn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>Allen, who had been an interested listener in the passageway,
stepped to Joe’s side. She had discarded
Marjorie’s sweater, and straightened her
dress. She looked a model trained nurse in her simple
white uniform. For a moment the others were
too astounded to speak.</p>

<p>“Are you Kathryn Allen?” asked Calhoun-Cooper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” proudly. “And your son has the honor to
be engaged to me.” She flashed a triumphant look
at Pauline whose indignation prevented speech on
her part.</p>

<p>“Where have you been most of the evening,
nurse?” questioned Calderon Fordyce sternly. “My
wife informed me, when I went to see how she was,
that you had been absent for over an hour.”</p>

<p>“I came downstairs to do an errand for her,”
lied Kathryn. “Your wife was asleep when I left
her.”</p>

<p>“I do not like such conduct,” said Fordyce curtly.
“I have already telephoned to the hospital for
another nurse. You may leave at once.”</p>

<p>Kathryn’s eyes blazed with wrath. “You&mdash;you&mdash;send
me away,” she paused to gain control of her
trembling voice. “You, whose own daughter is a
thief!”</p>

<p>“How dare you?” Both Calderon Fordyce and
Duncan moved toward the enraged woman. No one
paid the slightest attention to Marjorie and Paul
Potter who entered at that moment, and stood regarding
the tableau too surprised to speak.</p>

<p>“I am telling the truth,” shrieked Kathryn. “Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>Barnard and I both watched her take your ruby
pendant.”</p>

<p>There was dead silence as all eyes turned to Barnard.
Quickly he decided; helped by the promise he
read in Kathryn’s eyes: she would give him the
codicil if he backed up her charge against Janet.
Utterly unscrupulous himself, he never doubted that
Marjorie, on impulse, had stolen the codicil; his intense
egoism making him believe her past friendship
for him had prompted the theft. With that codicil
once safely in his possession he stood to win one
hundred thousand dollars. He could depend on
Kathryn’s dog-like fidelity if he showed her the slightest
affection. Janet? Well, Janet could go in the
discard. He cleared his throat nervously.</p>

<p>“The nurse’s story is quite true,” he acknowledged
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Calderon Fordyce staggered into the nearest chair,
and Duncan paused irresolute, as remembrances
crowded upon him.</p>

<p>“We saw Miss Fordyce go over to that desk, press
a spring, open the middle part, and take out the
case,” went on Kathryn vindictively, after casting a
grateful look on Barnard. He had not failed her.
“She removed the ruby pendant, replaced the case,
and left the room.”</p>

<p>“It’s all a rotten lie!” gasped Tom. “It must be,”
turning appealingly to Marjorie. But she stood
silent. She had done her loyal best, she could do no
more. The inevitable had happened.</p>

<p>“Did you tell your daughter that you had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>pendant, Fordyce?” asked Calhoun-Cooper, forgetting
for the moment Joe’s prospective matrimonial
plans.</p>

<p>“Yes, I showed it to her.”</p>

<p>“Anyone who reads the <i>Star</i> knew father had the
ruby,” said Duncan slowly.</p>

<p>“But no outsider knew where your father kept the
jewel,” interrupted Kathryn.</p>

<p>“Suppose you look and see if it is gone,” suggested
Duncan, and Calderon Fordyce rose and opened the
secret drawer. A groan of horror escaped him on
seeing the empty case.</p>

<p>“Janet saw me place the case in there,” he gasped.
“Her mother uses the secret drawer for many private
documents and sometimes for her jewelry. Janet,
my own dear daughter, a thief!” His agony was
unconcealed.</p>

<p>“Do not condemn Janet so soon,” said Paul Potter
quietly. “The girl was acting under auto-suggestion.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>arjorie</span> and the others gazed at the physician
in stupefied silence.</p>

<p>“I mean exactly what I said,” he went
on. “The girl was hypnotized.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t asleep,” protested Kathryn. “Her
eyes were wide open, and her manner was perfectly
natural. She knew what she was about.”</p>

<p>“That is not surprising or unusual,” answered
Potter. “In cases of animal magnetism the subject
is awake; has returned to what may be called her
normal state, is able to reflect, reason, and direct her
conduct; and yet under these conditions, she is influenced
by the auto-suggestion. The real thief is
the person who hypnotized Janet.”</p>

<p>“I tell you she was alone in this room,” declared
Kathryn stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I am not denying it,” the physician spoke with
quiet force. “At the will of the hypnotist the act of
stealing may be accomplished several hours, or even
two days after the date of auto-suggestion. Such
suggestion can only be realized at the given hour, and
cannot be realized until that hour arrives.”</p>

<p>“All very fine,” scoffed Kathryn. “But if Janet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>Fordyce was a poor girl she would be in jail by now.
Do you think you’d put up such a bluff for&mdash;Miss
Langdon, for instance?”</p>

<p>A light broke on Duncan and he stepped toward
Marjorie. “Have you known Janet stole?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered huskily. “I feared it was
kleptomania. I first saw her take a diamond sunburst
from Mrs. Walbridge’s dressing-table on
Christmas Eve.”</p>

<p>“And you never told?” Both voice and gesture
showed Duncan’s unbounded admiration and love as
he addressed Marjorie. “You let others think you
the thief!” His look repaid her for the suffering she
had endured.</p>

<p>“I watched Janet,” she confessed. “And whenever
I found anything in her possession which I knew
did not belong to her, I returned it to the rightful
owner.”</p>

<p>“How about my wife’s pearl necklace?” broke in
Calhoun-Cooper. “Did Miss Fordyce take that
also?”</p>

<p>“I fear so,” faltered Marjorie. “But I have never
seen the necklace in her possession.”</p>

<p>“Have you any objection to sending for your
daughter, Fordyce, and asking her to return the
necklace to me?”</p>

<p>Before Fordyce could reply to Calhoun-Cooper’s
question, Potter interrupted him.</p>

<p>“It will do little good,” he began. “Janet is herself
again, and all is forgotten; the crime, the impulse,
and the instigator.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to say we cannot learn the name
of the fiend who has used my daughter as a
puppet to accomplish his villany?” cried Fordyce
unbelievingly.</p>

<p>“Not unless we hypnotize Janet anew, when her
loss of memory will return. She can then probably
tell us the author of the suggestion, the time, the
place, and the manner.”</p>

<p>“A witness cannot be constrained to undergo
hypnotism,” put in Pauline, breaking her long silence.
“It is against the law.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know that?” asked Potter.</p>

<p>“A friend, who attended Janet’s boarding-school,
told me that a young teacher, who took a number of
pupils to see Keller, discovered that Janet was susceptible
to hypnotism. The magician used her as a
subject in the audience. Afterwards the teacher
often demonstrated her power over Janet. Mr.
Fordyce found it out”&mdash;Calderon Fordyce drinking
in every word nodded affirmatively, “and wished to
prosecute the teacher, but her lawyer refused to permit
Janet to be hypnotized so that she might testify
against her.”</p>

<p>“And how many people have you told that Janet
was a sympathetic subject for hypnotism?” asked
Potter. Pauline made no answer. “Your brother,
for instance?” she fidgeted uncomfortably, but again
refused to answer. “Just before dinner,” continued
the physician quietly, “I saw a man running down
the hall from this room; on coming in here I found
Janet in a hypnotic trance....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“Did you recognize the man?” questioned Duncan
swiftly.</p>

<p>“I did not; but he dropped this in his flight,” taking
out the silver pencil. “The initials engraved on
it are ‘J. C. C.’”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about the whole business,” protested
Joe vehemently. “I thought I heard raised
voices in here, and stopped to investigate....”</p>

<p>“Through the keyhole?” with sarcastic significance,
and Joe flushed.</p>

<p>“If I was on the other side of the door how did
I hypnotize Janet Fordyce?” he asked, avoiding his
father’s look.</p>

<p>Potter paid no attention to Joe’s remark, but continued
to address the others. “There is nothing
which suggestion cannot accomplish with a sensitive
subject. With a suggested act are connected sentiments,
emotions, passions, voluntary action, and all
the phenomena constituting the psychology of movement.
The suggestion which persists during the
waking state presents one interesting characteristic;
it appears to the subject to be spontaneous.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Janet was consciously a thief?”
exclaimed Fordyce aghast.</p>

<p>Potter evaded a direct reply. “The subject
generally supposes it to be a spontaneous act, and
sometimes she even invents reasons to explain her
conduct,” he said. “It is owing to this former fact
that it is not necessary for the hypnotist to indicate
in what way the crime is to be committed. Hurried
on by this irresistible force, the subject feels none of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>the doubts and hesitations of a real criminal, but acts
with a tranquility and security which insures the success
of the crime.”</p>

<p>“Your theory illustrates Spinoza’s remark that
‘the consciousness of free-will is only ignorance of the
cause of our acts’,” said Calhoun-Cooper reflectively.
“As my son seems to be involved in this affair, I must
ask you to examine your daughter; and the sooner
the better, for we are losing valuable time.”</p>

<p>“Miss Marjorie,” began Calderon Fordyce. “Tell
me who Janet has been with most frequently since
coming to Washington, and who are her confidential
friends.”</p>

<p>“Miss Langdon comes under that heading better
than anyone else,” interpolated Pauline, and her
spiteful manner made her meaning plain, but Marjorie
did not flinch under the attack. She was about
to speak when Potter answered for her.</p>

<p>“That is a matter of no moment,” he broke in.
“If Janet voluntarily alienated her free-will to a
magnetizer, though the latter may be only a casual
acquaintance, she is at his or her mercy; and by the
law of habit and repetition the control of a subject
becomes more easy and complete.”</p>

<p>“But is not a long interval required in which to
hypnotize a person?” asked Pauline doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No. Hypnotic sleep can be produced and terminated
in the time it takes a subject to traverse a
short passage from door to door, and an auto-suggestion
can be made in fifteen seconds and affected in
all places and at any hour of the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>Fordyce glanced at the physician appalled. “What
a frightful power for evil in unscrupulous hands.
Surely Janet will be able to tell us who has gained
so fearful a hold over her.”</p>

<p>Potter shook his head. “A suggestion will destroy
all recollection of what occurred during hypnotism.
As a rule the process which produced the auto-suggestion
leaves no trace of its symptoms, and the subject
does not remember the way it was produced, and
is altogether ignorant of the original source of the
impulse she has received.”</p>

<p>“Are we to sit here and do nothing, Paul?” demanded
Duncan hotly. The opening of the hall
door interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Why are you all staying in here?” asked Janet,
from the doorway. “Our other guests have
left....” A stricken silence prevailed as she
advanced into the room, and she was just becoming
aware of their concentrated attention when Potter
leaned forward, picked up the chamois-covered hammer
and struck the Chinese gong until the vibrations
filled the room. Thunderstruck, the others looked
at him, but he only saw Janet.</p>

<p>“Janet, where did you put the ruby pendant?” he
asked, authoritatively.</p>

<p>A crash broke the tense stillness as a statuette
toppled to the floor, but the interruption came too
late. Janet was deaf to her surroundings. She was
obsessed with but one idea.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find your coat,” she pleaded. “I had to
bring the pendant direct to you, Chichester.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>Barnard dashed the jewel out of her extended
palm and sprang for the door. But he was too late.
Tom Nichols, with murder in his heart, was there
before him, and he went down under the officer’s
blow.</p>

<p>“Let me finish him, Duncan,” begged Tom,
frantically, as the men dragged him off Barnard. “Let
me kill the dastardly hound!”</p>

<p>“Control yourself, Nichols,” commanded Potter
sternly. “Think of Janet.”</p>

<p>The admonition had the desired effect, and Tom,
much against his will, permitted Marjorie to lead
him away from the prostrate man.</p>

<p>“Is Janet in a hypnotic trance?” asked Duncan,
staring at his sister.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the physician. “Barnard hypnotized
her by means of sensorial excitement. I
suspected as much because earlier this evening,
I found Janet in a trance in the Chinese room, and
before entering that room I heard the sound of a
gong.”</p>

<p>“She struck the gong herself,” gasped Marjorie.</p>

<p>“Unconscious self-hypnotism,” commented Potter.
“Probably Barnard used musical instruments, or perhaps
the regular ticking of a clock to magnetize her
so frequently that the law of repetition had its way
when she heard the vibrations. I brought her back
to her normal condition by placing my hand to the
nape of her neck. Tell me,” he walked over and
planted a hearty kick in the small of Barnard’s back.
“What means did you use to awaken Janet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“Breathed on her forehead and eyes,” mumbled
the half-conscious man.</p>

<p>Quickly Potter aroused Janet. She shivered, and
turned and stretched out her hands to Tom.</p>

<p>“Take me away,” she said. “Oh, Tom, I asked
you at dinner to protect me from myself. I’m not
well&mdash;I tell you, I’m not well,” and she shook as
with an ague.</p>

<p>Utterly regardless of the others’ presence, Tom
gathered her in his strong arms. “I shall always
guard you, my darling,” he promised tenderly. “No
one shall come between us, and you will never be
tormented again. Come with me.”</p>

<p>Barnard staggered to his feet and tried to intercept
the lovers. Janet cowered back at his approach.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him touch me,” she pleaded piteously.
“He says I’m a kleptomaniac, and that I must steal,
steal&mdash;&mdash;” a shudder of repulsion shook her. “He
threatened to tell, he threatened to tell. Am I a
kleptomaniac, Tom, dear Tom, am I a kleptomaniac?”
Her eyes were alight with horror.</p>

<p>“No, no, my darling; you are only the dearest and
best sweetheart in the whole world”&mdash;Tom’s voice
quivered, and he held her close.</p>

<p>“But, Tom, I did find other people’s jewelry in my
possession sometimes, and how did I get it unless
I was a kleptomaniac?” Janet raised both hands
to her throbbing temples and burst into a storm of
tears.</p>

<p>“Go in the library with Nichols, Janet,” broke in
Potter. “He will explain away your&mdash;nightmare.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>Tom nodded understandingly as he caught the physician’s
warning glare, and he gently led Janet out of
the room. Barnard tried to slide after them, but
Duncan pulled him back and closed the hall door.</p>

<p>“State what you have to say to us,” he ordered,
“and be brief.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I refuse to make a statement?” replied
Barnard sullenly, nursing his bruised and bleeding
face.</p>

<p>“You will have plenty of time to think it over in
jail.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you intend to prosecute?”</p>

<p>“Did you doubt it?” Duncan’s eyes hardened; it
was only by exerting the utmost self-restraint that
he kept his hands off Barnard, so great was his fury
at the latter’s treatment of his sister.</p>

<p>“Have you counted the cost of publicity?” inquired
Barnard, with cool effrontery. Some of his
habitual composure was returning to him.</p>

<p>“Whatever the cost you shall suffer the full penalty
of the law. Father, call up the nearest precinct and
tell the sergeant to send here and arrest a thief....”</p>

<p>“And hypnotizer,” sneered Barnard, as Calderon
Fordyce stepped toward the door.</p>

<p>Joe, who had divided his time looking out of the
window and watching his companions, sidled up to
Kathryn, who stood next Barnard, and, while pretending
to pick up her handkerchief, whispered:</p>

<p>“I found your note. My taxi’s waiting outside.
You slip out there the first chance you get, and I’ll
follow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>She nodded understandingly as her eyes and Barnard’s
crossed, but Joe did not see their by-play.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” called Barnard, and Calderon
Fordyce paused undecidedly. “I’ll not keep you
waiting until my trial for an accurate account of my
business transactions with your daughter,” and he
laughed mockingly. “I needed money; always have
needed it. Miss Pauline,” indicating her with a
flippant wave of his hand, “told me Janet was easily
hypnotized, and it gave me the idea of compelling
her to steal for me. I had her practice by picking
up trifles; then came Tom Nichol’s coin, then money
and jewelry. I netted quite a tidy sum out of our
silent partnership....” He stepped back to
avoid Duncan’s furious leap toward him. Potter
promptly stepped between the two men, and in the
confusion Kathryn Allen slipped from the room.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Duncan,” commanded Potter. “Finish
your statement, Barnard.”</p>

<p>“There is very little to add,” said the latter, placing
the desk carefully between himself and Duncan.
“Sometimes Janet passed me the jewelry, sometimes
she lost it before she could get it to me. Your wife’s
necklace was a rich haul”&mdash;J. Calhoun-Cooper smiled
wryly. “I realized that if Janet was caught stealing,
she would only be thought a kleptomaniac. She
was tractable enough until I tried to make her turn
against Tom Nichols; then she grew stubborn.”</p>

<p>“Hypnotic subjects often rebel against injuring
those they love,” remarked Potter thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“She would have obeyed me in the end,” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>Barnard’s dark eyes flamed in sudden baffled rage.
“We might have gone on indefinitely, but I grew to
hate the influence you, Duncan Fordyce, exerted over
Marjorie”&mdash;Barnard’s manner betrayed genuine
emotion. “I planned to get her away from here.
Miss Pauline had told me when I accompanied her
home from the Charity Ball, that she suspected
Marjorie of stealing her mother’s pearl necklace,
and I suggested that she call here and charge
Marjorie with the theft, and also told her to ask
Janet what she knew of the theft. She said she
would go and see Mrs. Fordyce this morning, so
I made an appointment to see Janet before Miss
Pauline got here. I saw Janet alone, and by auto-suggestion
forced her to testify against Marjorie.”
A horrified gasp escaped Marjorie, and for the first
time he turned and looked fully at her. “I loathed
poverty and I loved you,” he said, and there was infinite
pathos in his charmingly modulated voice. “No
other woman counted,” he stumbled in his speech,
his passion mastering him. “My punishment lies in
losing you. Have you no word for me?” stretching
out his hands imploringly. But Marjorie bowed her
head, unable to speak. Potter, watching her closely,
saw she was on the point of collapse.</p>

<p>“Go and call the police, Duncan,” he began, then
stopped speaking as the room was plunged in darkness.</p>

<p>Barnard, taking his hand from the electric light
switch, sprang noiselessly out of the room and raced
down the hall, Duncan at his heels. He gained the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>front steps by a narrow margin, and one leap carried
him through the open door of the waiting taxi-cab.
Duncan stood watching the disappearing rear lights
of the taxi-cab with mixed emotions, then turned on
his heel and re-entered the house. He met the three
older men in the hall, and they accompanied him
back to the Chinese room. Joe turned from the
open window on their appearance.</p>

<p>“Did Kathryn go with Barnard?” he asked in a
voice he strove to make steady.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Duncan.</p>

<p>J. Calhoun-Cooper stepped forward at the sight
of his son’s grief-stricken face, and laid an affectionate
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come home with me, my boy,” he said, and his
tone gave Joe some ray of comfort. “I need you,”
and shoulder to shoulder, father and son stepped
from the room. Without speaking to the Fordyces,
Pauline followed her father and brother out into the
hall.</p>

<p>Potter slipped his arm inside Calderon Fordyce’s.
“Let us see them off the premises,” he suggested,
and paused only long enough to carefully close the
hall door behind them.</p>

<p>Left by themselves Duncan walked swiftly over
to Marjorie. He had not seen her alone since his
long-distance proposal at the dinner table. At his
approach Marjorie faltered and drew back, embarrassment
tinging her white cheeks a delicate pink.
Desperately she controlled an impulse to turn and
fly; then as she met the yearning tenderness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>his regard she half conquered her shyness and her
hand stole toward him in pleading surrender.
Intuitive knowledge guided Duncan as he laid
his cheek against her soft palm; she had been
sorely tried that day, her composure was at the
breaking point.</p>

<p>“What have you there?” he asked gently, pointing
to a long envelope which Marjorie clutched in one
nervous hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she steadied her voice with an
effort, and handed him the envelope. “My name
is written over your house address in the upper
left-hand corner, and it is addressed to Admiral
Lawrence. I found the envelope in the pocket of my
sweater which was lying on the floor behind this
door leading to your mother’s private staircase. I
have no idea how it got there.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had enough mysteries.” Duncan thrust
an impatient finger under the flap of the envelope
and tore it open; then drew out a folded typewritten
sheet and glanced hastily over it. “Jove! it’s the
signed codicil to Mrs. Lawrence’s will. I thought
I had solved that mystery.”</p>

<p>His surprise was reflected in Marjorie’s face. “I
know nothing about it,” she protested hotly. “I did
not address this envelope to Admiral Lawrence, nor
write my name in the corner....”</p>

<p>“But the person who stole the codicil inscribed it
for you,” exclaimed Duncan triumphantly. “And
also made free with your sweater. What else is in
the pockets?” thrusting his hand inside them. From
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>the last one he pulled out a piece of white linen.
“Why, it’s a nurse’s cap, and the initials ‘K. A.’ are
stamped inside it&mdash;&mdash;” turning the cap over in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Kathryn Allen!” exclaimed Marjorie. “She was
Mrs. Lawrence’s nurse, and was desperately in love
with Chichester Barnard....”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is the key to the riddle. She stole the
codicil after you left that afternoon; it was lying
conveniently to her hand on the desk where Alvord
had left it. She undoubtedly hoped that Barnard
would marry her and they would inherit Mrs. Lawrence’s
legacy.”</p>

<p>“But why should my name be on this envelope&mdash;it
looks as if I had sent the codicil back to Admiral
Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“That is obviously what she intended; probably
hoped to involve you in further trouble. Jove! now
she’s with Barnard, she’s probably longing to have
this codicil back in her possession,” as he spoke,
Duncan thrust the codicil inside the secret drawer.
“It can rest there for tonight; in the morning I’ll
take it to the Admiral, and then, good-bye to Chichester
Barnard’s inheritance. To think of his eloping
with a poor woman after all! I believe he knew
or suspected she had the codicil&mdash;what an awakening
for them both when they find she left the codicil
here.” Duncan shut the drawer, and turned to his
silent companion. “Marjorie, have you nothing to
say to me?”</p>

<p>Marjorie’s eyes fell before his ardent look. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>have so much that I do not know where to begin.
Ah, how can I thank you for your faith....”</p>

<p>“It was more than faith, Marjorie, it was the
master hand of love.”</p>

<p>And as his arms closed around her, she knew,
Oh, happy Marjorie, that she had won her woman’s
paradise at last.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
